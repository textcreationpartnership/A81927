            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou have acquainted me with the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſome of our leading men, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the prevailing ſide, to moderate matters, and compoſe our differences. Happy had this Church and State been if that aime had been carried all along from the beginning in the Counſells and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of thoſe,<note place="margin">The occaſion and ſcope of this letter.</note> who have been intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with the management of affaires; and if it be not now too late to quench this flame, or if it can be hoped that in the midſt of ſo great feares, ſo many jealouſies, ſo different practiſes, and ſo loud clamours, and ſo ſenſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, mens ſpirits can be brought to mutualll confidence and made ſuſceptible of temperate thoughts towards one another, I would adviſe all, but chiefly ſuch as have power in the Houſes, in the Citie, in the Aſſembly, in the Army, and moſt of all the Generall and the Lieutenant generall, on whom the eyes of moſt men are fixed, to proceed after this manner, and lead as in this way.</p>
            <p>Firſt, let our ayme bee (as in the ſight of God who tryeth the Reines) to purge our heart from a deſigne to ſerve the intereſts
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116741:4"/>of one ſide,<note place="margin">What ought zo bee the right aime of thoſe that treat for peace.</note> mainly to croſſe another. For he that lookes upon his Brother with the eye of a partie, hath put out the eye of a Chriſtian. A Chriſtian doth not take notice of men after the fleſh, hee lookes upon the new creature in every one, and hee that doth not walke after this Rule, there can be nothing but miſery and deſtruction in his wayes, for the way of peace and truth hee hath not knowne.</p>
            <p>Secondly, then if wee can cleer our aimes from partialitie, our Counſels may be free from prejudice, and if this be, we will not ſhunne the light but deſire to ſhew that our workes are wrought in God; and will bee ready to declare to all in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the true rules and maximes, by which our conſcience is guided;<note place="margin">How they ſhould mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt their aime.</note> by which wee intend to walke, and by which wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to bee judged, by all, in our proceedings; but if wee either have no ſuch rules, or are not willing to declare them; wee ſhunne the light, wee love darkeneſſe, and let us not deceive our ſelves, there is no truth nor love to peace in us. And what although hitherto perhaps wee have not minded conſcionably the equitable and charitable affections which the Spirit of Chriſt doth ſuggeſt; yet now being put in minde thereof, if henceforth the motions of his Spirit bee not rejected but ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained, openly profeſſed, and effectually followed, who doth not know but that yet a happy compoſure of our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences may be effected?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Declarations of the truth that is in us, are good; but however they are no more but words; except then reall actions anſwer them,<note place="margin">How they ſhould proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute thier aime.</note> and ſpeake the truth of juſtice and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe in our proceedings, there can bee nothing but bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the end. For nothing can prevent the croſſe workings of mens ſpirits againſt us, but that which is able to beget and ſettle a confidence in their mindes towards us; and to beget this confidence, and allay theſe jealouſies which cauſe mens ſpirits boyle up to a diſturbance of thoſe proceedings wherein wee meane well: I would ſuggeſt to our leading men theſe impartiall conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">The parts of this diſcourſe.</note>1 That they ought to lay to heart the cauſes which hinder others to confide in us, to remove the ſame.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That they ought to ſeeke and finde out the perſons which are moſt capable of receiving good impreſſions of us and from us, that the ſame may bee given them, and by them propagated unto all.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:116741:4"/> 3 That they ſhould make uſe of the proper meanes by which confidence is bred in honeſt mindes towards us, that the ſame may bee ſet a working.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That they ſhould obſerve the method and manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding requiſite in doing this, that the attempt may bee effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and not miſcarry.</p>
            <p>Of theſe foure heads I ſhall ſuggeſt ſomewhat tending to the advancement of peace and truth as briefly as I can.</p>
            <p>Firſt, concerning the cauſes hindering others to confide in us, and begetting feares in them againſt us, let me ſay this:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The cauſes of miſtruſt and feare.</note>He that doth not confide in his neighbours, doth hinder them to confide in him, and hee that doth feare others, doth beget in them cauſes of feare againſt himſelfe; if then wee would have others to confide in us and not feare us, wee muſt alſo confide in them and not feare them. For if I cannot bring my ſpirit to truſt my neighbour, how can I expect that his ſpirit ſhould bee brought to truſt me? and if I thinke that hee doth not truſt me, I will readily ſuſpect him: if I ſuſpect him, I will either arme my ſelfe to oppoſe him, or weaken him leſt hee oppoſe mee; and if I give way to theſe thoughts, I am at warre with him in my heart, and the affection of Chriſtian love and ingenuitie, which onely can beget confidence, is loſt between us; love being loſt, the fruits of emulation, envie and paſſion will bee found, and break forth in our nature.</p>
            <p>I finde the ſequele of matters in our nature to lie thus:</p>
            <p>Where I doe not love, I cannot confide; where I confide not, I will finde cauſe to miſtruſt; where I finde cauſe to miſtruſt, I will fortifie my ſelfe againſt the ſame; and if I fortifie my ſelfe againſt my neighbour, I muſt expect that hee will doe the like againſt mee (for what cauſe hath hee to truſt mee more then I doe him?) therefore as long as I manifeſt no love, nor truſt, but force onely, there can bee no confidence expected from any towards mee. The maine hinderance then of confidence and cauſe of feare is the endeavour of force; and if I once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to endeavour force, I ſeeke not onely ſecurity to my ſelfe, but the conqueſt of that which I thinke is mine op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit; becauſe I cannot naturally reſt ſecure as long as that which I count an enemy is not ſubdued; and whatſoever I doe not truſt, I am apt to account an enemy; therefore whilſt I make nothing my friend but mine owne force, I am apt to truſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116741:5"/>to nothing elſe but it. From all which this doth follow, that as ſoone as I forſake the ſimplicitie of my love, I beget naturally feares within my ſelfe; and when I take a courſe to ſecure my ſelfe from my feares by force, I multiply feares in others, and give them cauſe to miſtruſt me. Let me then cure mine owne feares firſt which I have of others, and then I ſhall bee able to cure the feares which others have of me: if I take the beame out of mine owne eye, I ſhall ſee cleer to take the moat out of my neighbours.</p>

               </label> To anſwer this,<note place="margin">Matth. 7.12.</note> the Doctrin and Rule of Chriſt is without all exception. <hi>Whatſoever you would have others to doe to you, doe you to them alſo;</hi> the meaning is, doe you it firſt unto them, for we are commanded, <hi>to conſider one another to provoke each other to love and to good workes.</hi> If I muſt conſider to provoke, then hee that is to bee provoked to love,<note place="margin">The way to follow that which is good.</note> hath not yet applyed himſelf unto the dutie, but I am obliged to goe before him in the way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and therefore I muſt expreſſe my love to him firſt, although hee hath not done his dutie to mee. If then I would have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to truſt me, it is cleere by this rule, that I muſt firſt ſhew that I doe truſt him, but if I ſhew not this, then I provoke him to the contrary, namely, not to truſt mee. And if but the Law, which the Gentiles by common nature knew, were heeded in this caſe, it would take away the cauſes of our differences and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, and teach us to follow that which is good. <hi>Quod tibi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris,</hi> What thou wouldeſt not have done to thy ſelf, doe not thou to any. Is it that thou wouldeſt not have any feare thee, or ſuſpect thee, or arme himſelfe againſt thee? then doe not thou feare and ſuſpect him, or arme thy ſelfe againſt him. Wouldſt thou not have all thy faults ript up, and all advantages taken againſt thee, to bring thee into diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, then rip not up the faults of others, and take no advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges againſt them to diſcredit them? Wouldſt thou not be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, condemned and diſarmed? doe not judge, condemne and endeavour to diſarme others; <hi>For with what judgement thou judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 7.2.</note> 
               <hi>thou ſhalt be judged, and with what meaſure thou doſt mete, it ſhall bee meaſured unto thee againe;</hi> and if thou wilt diſarme others and keepe them as captives under thy power,<note place="margin">Rev. 13.10. Eſa. 33.1.</note> thou muſt expect to bee diſarmed and led captive under the power of others, for God doth render to every one according to his workes. Wilt thou then follow that which is good? doe not make thy ſelfe terrible unto any, becauſe thou wouldeſt have none to be terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto thee; cure thine owne diſtempers, meane well towards others, and as thou haſt opportunitie, make the power which thou haſt in thine hand ſerviceable unto others for good; for hee that hath power to doe good to thoſe that are under his power and doth it not, is fooliſh and weake; and by not uſing his power to the end for which it is given, doth overthrow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by it. <hi>Summiſque negatum ſtare diu,</hi> things at the height ſtand not long. Therefore if a man hath not learned of Chriſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116741:6"/>to deny himſelfe in the uſe of his power, hee muſt fall under the weight of it; now the weight of it is nothing elſe but the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of State which it begets in others that are equalls or infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors.</p>
            <p>I have done with the cauſes hindering others to confide in us.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. The way to finde out ſuch as we ought to deale withall is,</note>The ſecond thing to bee conſidered is, How wee ſhall finde out thoſe that are fitteſt to entertaine and receive the good which wee doe follow, and in caſe of averſion from us, how to make them ſuſceptible of better impreſſions. For to conquer the world, it is not enough to meane well, and to doe that which in it ſelfe is good, but the good which is done, muſt bee well placed alſo. A good ſeed ſhould be ſowen in fruitfull ground, elſe how will it multiply?</p>
            <p>Now to doe this, let me offer theſe thoughts.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">1. To free our ſelves from prejudice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all.</note>1 No man is able exactly to diſcerne his owne, farre leſſe other mens hearts; our prejudicate opinions deceive us no where more then in the thoughts of perſons, the imaginations which wee frame to our ſelves of others and of their principles inſnare our affections, and ſhut us up from that freedome of ſpirit towards them which might bee a meanes either to gaine or to diſcover them to us; for they byas our proceedings and corrupt that ingenuitie, without which wee are darkned, and neither can diſcerne others, nor be diſcerned by them in truth. For when wee apply our ſelves to one this way, and to another that way, and doe not walke equally by the plain Rule of the new creature towards all, wee muſt needs be intangled, and loſe our ſtrength; which is upheld by nothing ſo much, as by that plainneſſe wherein it is alwayes like it ſelfe. Our various pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions of men, and of their different deſignes, cauſe us to be with child, and when they have put us in pain, they make us bring forth as it were wind; nor can wee at all worke any deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in the earth by them to our ſelves or others, becauſe we bring nothing but earthly wiſedome with us, to ſubdue the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men, before which the inhabitants of the world will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall. Therefore if wee would ſeeke out and find thoſe that are fit to receive the good which wee would offer to them, let us never take upon us to judge determinately of any man this or that way according to appearances; but leaving him to God and himſelfe, let us judge righteous judgement; as wee deſire
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116741:6"/>others to judge and preſume of us by the Rules of Charity, ſo let us apply our thoughts unto them, for this will keep us in a frame of freedome within our ſelves and ingenuity towards them, without which no ſafe addreſſe can bee made unto any.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">2. To addreſſe our ſelves to all by one rule, &amp; obſerve by whom the good which is offered is reſented.</note>2 To diſcover then ſuch as are capable of the good which wee doe follow, wee muſt addreſſe our ſelves unto all alike by one and the ſame Rule of ſincerity and truth; and where wee finde that the good which wee have proſecuted is reſented, there we ſhould apply our ſelves more particularly to multiply the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation thereof unto them, and to fix more deeply the ſenſe thereof into their apprehenſions: For where wee ſee that God doth cauſe the ſeed which is ſowen to take root, there wee may hope that being watered it will fructifie by his bleſſing.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">3. To make a more ſpeciall application to thoſe that are of note.</note>3 And although our addreſſes ſhould bee thus towards all, yet this muſt not hinder a more ſpeciall application of our ſelfe to ſome, who are likely to bee more capable then others of good motions: ſuch then as are of good report for piety and parts, ſuch as are noted for temper and moderation from humane paſſions, and ſuch as are apparently zealous for the workes of Reformation, ought to bee lookt upon with a ſpeciall eye and ſought out. They ought to be dealt withall more plainly and more fully, for the ſetting of their judgements aright and the clearing of doubts which they may have concerning our wayes and principles: and then wee ought alſo to put an edge upon their affections to concurre with us towards a progreſſe in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like workes; that the righteouſneſſe which doth reach alike unto the edification of all, may bee advanced for the complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the work of our reformation.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <note place="margin">4. Not to bee much ſwayed with good or evill reports concerning any, but to meaſure all by the true ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, the life of Chriſt in the Spirit.</note>4 And as publick and private reports are not altogether to bee ſlighted for the finding out of men, ſo are they not either way eaſily and much to bee credited: for they are carried for the moſt part by intereſts, and a man of judgement that doth ſet a rule unto himſelfe in all his wayes, will both on this fide and on that ſide arme himſelfe againſt the ſtrong impreſſions of evill and good reports. Againſt the evill ones hee will have in ſtore charitable conſtructions of things that may bee well taken, leſt his ſpirit be raſhly byaſed to a wrongfull affection againſt him that deſerveth it not; and againſt the largeneſſe of the good ones hee will ballance himſelfe with diſcretion and prudence,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116741:7"/>leſt hee bee ſwayed through too much credulity to a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe confidence in one that may deceive him; and thus keeping himſelfe both wayes free, in an equall temper, neither too high nor too low in his apprehenſions, to riſe and fall with the blaſts of reports, hee will bee able to ſteer an even courſe in his cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age towards all; meaſuring himſelfe and all other men in his and their actions by one and the ſame rule, which is the life of Chriſt in the Spirit: for that is the onely ſtandard by which all are to bee meaſured, that is the onely touchſtone by which all ſpirits are to bee tryed whether they bee true gold or not.</p>
            <p>In this ſearch and diſcoverie of perſons, although none are to bee excluded of what qualitie and condition ſoever, yet thoſe that are called Divines are chiefly to bee ſought after, becauſe they have a great influence upon the ſpirits both of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and alſo of the ordinary ſort of ſtayed men to ſway their affections. Except then wee deale with theſe men according to theſe rules to gaine them to our ayme, wee ſhall finde the wayes of peace and union mainely obſtructed, and the gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe now ſtirred and overflowing in many, almoſt impoſſible to be allayed.</p>
            <p>I have done with the diſcovery of perſons fit to bee dealt withall.</p>
            <p>The third point is concerning the means by which confidence may bee begotten in theſe towards us, and ſet a working to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all, for the compoſure of differences. This meanes I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is none other but a free and orderly Treatie to be ſet afoot between ſome of us and ſome of their ſide. And to the end that by this meanes mutuall confidence may bee begotten,<note place="margin">The meanes to beget confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, of which the requiſites are briefly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> equall power to propoſe matters to bee taken into conſideration, and equall freedome from awfull preſcriptions muſt bee aſſured unto all, and an equall engagement muſt bee conſcionably laid upon all alike to meet; to meet I ſay conſtantly and never to leave off the Treatie, till the end for which it ſhall bee undertaken be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, or at leaſt the courſe which therein ſhould bee followed ſhall be brought to a full period.</p>
            <p>The diſagreement was originally about the frame and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Churches,<note place="margin">The ſubject thereof is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</note> but now it is about the power of ſetling the government of the Kingdome; the firſt controverſie hath ſtill an influence upon the latter, ſo that this will never bee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116741:7"/>well agreed, without ſome determination of that.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. Concerning civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to bee tranſacted in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>The treaty concerning Civill government, can bee no where ſet a foot but in the Parliament. The Parliament is there, where by the Kings authority according to the conſtitution of the Kingdome, the bodies of Peeres and Commons are met, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the affaires of the Kingdome intruſted to their care: Onely now for matter of order, it is to bee wiſhed, that the things henceforth to bee debated and voted ſhould looke rather for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward then backward: that is, that the Houſes ſhould rather determine things tending to our ſettlement in time to come; then alter or unſettle things preſent, or call things paſt into queſtion before our ſettlement bee in view, or the foundation thereof eſtabliſhed. If an Act of Oblivion were paſt on all ſides, for things done in the heat of ſtrife ſince the parties were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and poſitive Counſels entertained for preventing of breaches hereafter; wee might hope to ſee better dayes ſhortly, then otherwiſe wee are like to enjoy in this generation.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall leave the civill Treaties to thoſe to whom they are intruſted by the Kingdome, and beſeeching the Lord to give them one mind in his feare, to make them all faithfull to their publick truſt without ſelfe-ſeeking, and intereſts of parties, I ſhall ſpeake of a Treatie which may relate unto the ſettlement of the Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. Concerning Church mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. To advance which,</note>This Eccleſiaſticall Treatie is of abſolute neceſſitie, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous men may not miſtake one another, as for the moſt part in theſe differences they doe; for it is cleer that matters are miſunderſtood on both ſides; and being miſrepreſented hainouſly to the ſimple multitude by many, and no body la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring effectually to rectifie miſtakes,<note place="margin">1 Railing is to be reſtrained on all ſides.</note> our diviſions muſt needs bee multiplied, and our breaches made greater. If then the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which hitherto hath been taken and abuſed on both ſides, to traduce each other in the Preſſe and Pulpit, can neither by authoritie nor by perſwaſion bee reſtrained, wee are never like to gaine any advantage for the compoſure of mens affections by a Treatie, though never ſo faire, never ſo orderly, never ſo peaceable and effectuall in it ſelfe; for it will never become ſo unto others; becauſe as long as the windes blow fiercely, the Seas will bee ſtormie; as long as railing accuſations continue, paſſions will bee raiſed; and whiles paſſions rule, conſcience is aſleepe, judgement is darkned, and men are not capable of rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall

For this Reaſon alſo, the men to be choſen for the Treatie on both ſides, muſt not onely be conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable, judicious and learned, but moreover free from all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingagement and paſſion.<note place="margin">2. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie is to be had to ſet it afoot.</note> Then the Treatie it ſelfe although for the ſame cauſe it may not bee publick (for then it muſt have publick authoritie, whereupon a thouſand inconveniences will follow to make it fruitleſſe) yet it muſt not bee altogether pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, but ſhould have the foreknowledge and countenance of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to beget it, leſt it be wholly ſlighted and inconſiderable: So then let ſome of the peaceable and chiefe leading Stateſ-men of both ſides (being thereto either deputed or allowed by the reſt of each ſide) order and direct the Treatie in a courſe which ſhall bee wholly free from partialitie, and let a jealouſie be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt the intent and purpoſe of ſuch a Treatie, let it bee declared that it ſhall not bee to conclude any thing (for that cannot bee done without the full knowledge and conſent of parties) but onely to try what hopes there may bee of finding a ſure way to procure an accommodation, either by the meanes of a reconcilement, or by the meanes of a mutuall forbearance of in offenſive differences.<note place="margin">3. The perſons are not to bee many who treat.</note> Such a Treatie of three or at the moſt of foure chiefe Divines on each ſide, who ſhould be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet apart from all other imployments to apply themſelves day and night to this worke, and who ſhould have the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, at all times ſeverally and joyntly without the formalitie of an ordinary Committee to meet, may by Gods bleſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a meanes to lay the ground of a confidence betweene the parties; if onely the fit method and manner of proceeding firſt in the Treatie it ſelfe, and then in the communication of that which they ſhall agree upon can bee obſerved.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons why I would have no more but three or at the moſt foure on each ſide to treat are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Three or foure truely moderate and quiet ſpirited men, will bee ſooner found, eaſier ſpared from other taskes, and be able to meet more frequently, and conſtantly then a greater number on each ſide.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This ſmaller number will bee leſſe ſubject to diſtraction and diſagreement within it ſelfe then a greater number.</p>
            <p n="3">3 This number will bee ſufficient to make a tryall, and to diſcover the way towards an Accommodation which without prejudice to either ſide may bee tendered to all. But if a great
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116741:8"/>number ſhould bee engaged on each ſide, they might beget a new diviſion if the parties ſhould not conſent unto their reſults.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The way and method of Treating, which is onely ſafe, and wherein lyeth a ſecret inforcement towards an agreement in Chriſtianitie cannot be followed by many ſo well as by few. And to make this good,</p>
            <p>Let us now ſpeake of the laſt point which is the method and manner of proceeding both in the Treatie it ſelfe,<note place="margin">4. The method and manner of proceeding in the treaty.</note> and in the communication of the reſults thereof to gaine the aſſent of parties.</p>
            <p>In this method and manner of proceeding, ſomething there muſt bee preliminary to make the worke more ſad and ſerious to thoſe that goe about it, and theſe that goe about the work, more pious and conſcientious in it. Something there muſt bee alſo decretorily obſerved to make the worke more orderly and effectuall towards the end for which it is to bee ſet afoot.</p>
            <p>As for the preliminary or preparatory worke, I would have the Divines that ſhall bee choſen and thoſe that doe chooſe them to meete alone, to ſet a day privately apart amongſt themſelves,<note place="margin">1. For the preliminaries.</note> to ſeeke Gods face with Faſting and Prayer, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his direction in the worke which they ſhall take in hand. At this time of their humiliation I would have them to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed not onely in Prayers and mutuall exhortations to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke each other to the duties of ſervent love and of ſinceritie; but alſo in conferences whereby they ſhould (as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God calling upon him at the propoſall of every new matter) deliberate upon three points. Firſt, of the diſtinct and particular end which they ſhould ſet before their eyes in their future Treatie to determine it. Secondly, of the ſpeciall and appropriate meanes to reach that end in righteouſneſſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will of God. Thirdly, of the orderly courſe which ſhould be followed in the proſecution of theſe meanes by their Treatie amongſt themſelves. Of which three heads a Note ſhould be made in writing for a memoriall and rule of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to bee faithfully obſerved. Herein all ſhould declare their willingneſſe to be engaged towards each other as in the feare and preſence of God, and that the engagement may bee more effectually binding, and not liable to doubts in time to come, at the end of the day and of their conference they ſhould atteſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116741:9"/>and ſolemnize their mutuall engagement by the ſubſcription of their hands unto an Act or inſtument which afterward ſhould bee laid up in the Repoſiorie where all their other Acts are to bee kept as the ground of their future proceeding. And I would adviſe that amongſt other things to be mentioned in that Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or Inſtrument, they would oblige themſelves expreſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe clauſes. 1. That they ſhall not onely doe all things conſcionably and ſincerely between God and themſelves, but alſo that they ſhall deale openly and clearely one toward ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without all mentall Reſervations, in all points of their Treatie. 2. That they ſhall looke to nothing in all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations but to the proſecution of clear and undeniable duties of Chriſtianitie, without any reſpect to outward intereſts to their relations unto parties, or to any humane concernments whatſoever. 3. That none ſhall ſecretly divulge or openly publiſh any thing which in their Treatie ſhall be agreed upon as an Act, neither by word of mouth or otherwiſe directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly to any; without foreknowledge, leave and full conſent of all that are joyned in the Treatie. 4. That nothing in the world ſhall retard or ſtop them from endeavouring to proceed conſtantly towards the Period of their Treatie which they ſhall have agreed upon to proſecute.</p>
            <p>And for the better obſervation of theſe clauſes I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the Stateſ-men themſelves by whoſe authority they ſhould bee called and appointed to meet; not to deſire to know any of the reſults of their Treatie, before it bee brought to a full Perſon, and they of themſelves thinke it fit to impart the ſame unto them. I have pregnant reaſons for this, which I need not here to mention. It will bee abſolutely moſt expedient, that immediatly after the firſt meeting (wherein the Stateſ-men ſhould be with them to enter them upon their work) they ſhould whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leave them unto themſelves; except onely to call upon them now and then from time to time to encourage them to proceed conſtantly without interruption.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. For the worke it ſelf and the way to proceed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</note>And thus much for the preparative ingagements, now I come to the work of the meeting to give advice concerning the matter, the manner, and the circumſtances thereof, to make it orderly within it ſelf, and without all prejudice effectuall towards others, which will bee if the right way of communicating their reſults be taken and followed.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:116741:9"/>
            <p> In theſe things I ſhall bee brief, becauſe the particular deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of all things of this nature, doth belong properly to thoſe that are appointed to meet; yet becauſe generalls may give without all prejudice ſome overtures to advince their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation; I ſhall offer theſe following thoughts to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, then I conceive that all their meetings to treat ſhould begin and end with prayers, and that by turnes one of each ſide ſhould preſide and lead their actions, ſo that every time by courſe a new man ſhould have the chaire.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he that doth preſide or lead the action ſhall gather the reſults and put them to paper; and after the Treatie they ſhall be regiſtred in the booke of their Acts, and at the end of every meeting ſubſcribed by all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there ſhall bee two books kept, one containing the Diurnall or brief Narrative of the daily proceedings of each Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: another containing nothing elſe but the reſults of each trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or the advices which ſhall be agreed upon, to advance the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of differences.</p>
            <p n="4">4 To keepe theſe two bookes there ſhall be a peculiar Trunk or Cheſt or Box, with two ſeverall lockes fixed to the meeting place, and every one of the one ſide ſhall have a key for the one locke, and every one of the other ſide a key for the other lock, ſo that none of either ſide alone ſhall bee able to open the Cheff, but any two of both ſides ſhall have power to doe it; and to make uſe of their Regiſters as they ſhall think good.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The times of their meetings ſhould bee conſtantly appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted once for all, and inviolably obſerved, becauſe they are wholly to bee ſet apart to attend the worke without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
            <p n="6">6 If at any time by reaſon of ſome invincible impediment, as of ſickneſſe or ſome other unavoidable accident, one of the number be abſent, the meeting ſhall not bee void; yet the Acts thereof ſhall not be Regiſtred, till he that was abſent hath ſeen them and approved of them.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Nothing ſhall bee carried by the major part of voices, what is not conſented unto by all ſhall not bee any Act.</p>
            <p n="8">8 The matter of the Treatie ſhall not bee concerning doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall truths, becauſe it is ſuppoſed that there is no materiall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116741:10"/>therein between the parties: but concerning practicall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties relating either to the conſtitution or to the government of the Churches, or to the exerciſe of Religious worſhip, in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate or publick way.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The manner of their Treaty ſhall not proceed by way of debate and diſpute to argue what is right or wrong, in reſpect of the particular practiſes of parties, but it ſhall proceed in the way of poſitive Declarations and Anſwers unto certaine Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, which ſhall bee propoſed as caſes of conſcience, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved from the Word of God, and the undeniable principles of Chriſtianitie.</p>
            <p n="10">10. He then that ſitteth in the chaire ſhall aske of every one what matter he would have taken into conſideration; what ſhall be offered by every one ſhall be noted in a memoriall by it ſelf; then the queſtion ſhall be in what order the things offered ſhall be thought upon, and when that which is to be firſt in order ſhall be determined, a queſtion ſhall bee framed thereof, as a caſe of conſcience to be reſolved by the word; from which every one ſhall gather his Anſwer, and bring it in againſt the next meeting in writing, and when the writings are compared, that wherein they all doe agree, ſhall onely be taken as a reſult of their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; and that wherein they differ ſhall be left untouched, except ſome propoſall be made which doth take with all, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement of the difference.</p>
            <p n="11">11 In bringing in their anſwers they ſhall avoid large diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſet downe that which they ſhall deliver, upon the point to be reſolved, in ſhort Aphoriſmes and Propoſitions <hi>per theſim &amp; Antitheſim:</hi> and to facilitate the matter, each ſide ſhould contract their ſeverall anſwers into one ſumme, containing that in which they all doe agree; that ſo at their meeting together, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon may be made onely between two writings, out of which the agreement is to be extracted, as a common reſult upon the Queſtion which was propoſed.</p>
            <p n="12">12 When the reſolutions of all profitable queſtions tending to an accommodation of our differences, ſhall be thus gathered without contradictory debates into cleer and diſtinct propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which ſhall be taken from Gods Word, to be offered as an advice unto the diſſenting parties towards an agreement; then they ſhall be put into ſome order and ranked under their proper
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:116741:10"/>heads of matters, to be communicated unto the reſt of each ſide.</p>
            <p n="13">13 The way of communicating matters I conceive may bee this:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. For the communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that which ſhall be concluded.</note>Firſt, let the preliminarie determinations of the Treaty bee publiſhed by ſetting forth the Art and Inſtrument of the mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all engagement of thoſe that are called to the Treatie, and let this be done immediatly after the Treaty is begun, to the end that the reſt of both ſides may know the end of the Treaty, and bee deſired to recommend the effect thereof to God in their publick and private Prayers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when the Treatie is at an end, let there bee a brief narrative publiſhed of the order and method of proceeding uſed in the Treatie, to let all ſee how equally and amiably matters have been carried.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when this is done towards all indifferently, then let the reſults of all the deliberations upon all the queſtions be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but not made common to all; onely firſt to the Stateſ-men who ſet the Treaty afoot a certaine number of copies are to bee imparted, that they may diſtribute and ſend the ſame to the moſt peaceable and moderate ſpirits of each ſide, to engage them to declare how farre they give their aſſent thereunto, and when the chief ſhall have declared their ſenſe thereof, and it doth appeare that the advice is not rejected; the Houſes of Parliament may be moved to move the Aſſembly of Divines to declare their ſenſe and approbation of the ſame; which being done, the Houſes ſhould concurre with their authority not onely to permit, but to recommend the practiſe thereof unto all.</p>
            <p>Thus I have done for the preſent with theſe ſuggeſtions rather to ſatisfie your deſire, and diſcharge mine owne conſcience, then that I have any great hope they will bee laid to heart; yet who knoweth where this ſeed may fall, and what God may doe with it? I know aſſuredly that hee will <hi>doe good to Iſrael to theſe that are of a cleane heart:</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou know what hopes you gave me when I was at <hi>Sion Houſe,</hi> that ſome effectuall courſe would bee followed to reconcile our differences about matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I did thereupon impart unto you very freely my thoughts concerning the whole buſineſſe, how it might bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced as I conceived.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Treatie of an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun at <hi>London.</hi>
               </note>Since that time being here at <hi>London,</hi> the hopes which you gave me were confirmed by the zeale and forwardneſſe of thoſe, who in the Citie gave occaſion to the beſt affected to meet at ſeverall conferences, whereof the ayme was very laudable and neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> to prevent both in Church and State the imminent dangers of Tyranny on the one hand, and of Anarchie on the other: and to find out and ſet on foot the meanes of brotherly unitie and amiable concurrence in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the worke of our preſent Reformation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">But without effect left off.</note>What the particular cauſes are wherefore the motions then made were not effectuall, and the conferences of this kind have ſince beene left off: I ſhall not at all mention, for you know them well enough; and wee all have juſt cauſe to mourne for this, that in our outward profeſſion of the Goſpell, there is ſo little true ſpirituall zeale for neceſſary duties of Communion, and ſo much for private concernments; and that our diſeaſe if
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:116741:11"/>wee continue long in theſe diſtempers, is like to prove reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſſe.</p>
            <p>As for me, although I cannot but lay this ſadly to heart, yet I doe not ſuffer the diſcouragements which cauſe moſt men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire to worke upon my ſpirit any fainting impreſſions: but have rather given way to a charitable inclination, which I love to entertaine within my ſelf, which is, to hope for a poſſibilitie of our reconcilement, notwithſtanding all the backwardneſſe which is apparent in the leading men of both ſide. I have (I ſay) kept up my ſpirits, in a reſolution to proceed in theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions partly upon this hope, partly upon other principles,<note place="margin">The falſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of ſome men in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> then I perceive moſt men doe walke by: for moſt men move onely as they finde cauſe by outward appearances to expect the ſucceſſe of their enterpriſes, and ſome are ſo very tender of their repute of being engaged, that except they bee ſure of gaining what they pretend to ſeeke, they will not hazzard their labour, nor ſeeme forward in any thing, although in it ſelf never ſo anſwerable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the way of God in the Goſpell. But I have beene otherwiſe taught to look upon my ſelf: I ſhall never value my credit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, or my paines above my duty; I ſhall never bee afraid to be counted a foole to the prudent of this age, and to loſe my labour for the Goſpels ſake. Hee that cannot freely venture the reputation of his prudencie upon the ground of a dutie, without conſulting the appearances of fleſh and blood, is not yet inſtructed to walke by Faith and above ſenſe, and hee that is not willing to ſerve Chriſt without ſucceſſe, is not worthy to bee imployed by him. Therefore I conceive that in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of <hi>ſeeking peace and enſuing it,</hi> which God doth command me to doe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.14. and <hi>of maintaining peace, if it bee poſſible, and as much as in me lyeth,</hi> which in like manner is commanded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18. (I ſay in this buſineſſe thus injoyned and bound up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my conſcience) I conceive that I owe to God an implicit obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;<note place="margin">What the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution ought to be of him that ſeeketh peace accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods will.</note> that is to ſay, an obedientiall reſolution, and an attempt to doe what I can towards the effect, although I ſee no appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſucceſſe: for he that commands me <hi>to hunt peace,</hi> doth preſuppoſe that it will <hi>flee from me,</hi> and when it is fled, hee that doth bid me <hi>overtake it,</hi> and if I overtake it, to <hi>hold it faſt if it bee poſſible, and as much as in me lyeth,</hi> doth not therefore give me any aſſurance that I ſhall overtake it, and bee able to hold it; but
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:116741:12"/>this onely hee requireth, that I ſhould do my utmoſt endeavors. Now if I demurre upon the matter, and will not do this except I can perceive that I ſhall bee able to doe it,<note place="margin">What the lets of ſuch a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution are.</note> as I pretend for my credit: in this caſe I ſerve not the will of him that commands me, but mine owne: for I walke not in the obedience of Faith, but in the dictates of my phanſie: for now I leane to mine owne underſtanding, and ſuffer the pride of my heart to bee my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour, which being unwilling to be foiled in any undertaking, doth make me quit the worke, becauſe I thinke I ſhall not have the credit of it. But if for ſome other reaſons, I demurre upon the dutie and ſuſpend mine action, as perhaps, becauſe I ſee not I can gaine this or that benefit by it; or becauſe I thinke it not ſeaſonable to appeare till matters of State bee ſo and ſo contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; that ſuch and ſuch a buſineſſe may come in at ſuch a time for ſuch a deſigne, &amp;c. (although in matters meerely humane, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and externall, I doe not blame this prudentiall contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; yet I ſay) if any ſuch conſideration ſhould byas my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution towards the performance of that which in it ſelf is a dutie, and of a ſpirituall nature, (as I feare it doth with many) then I walke no more by the grace of God in ſimplicitie, but by the wiſedome of men in the world; then my aime is not to ſerve Chriſt, but rather to make uſe of Chriſt and his kingdome, and of my intereſt in the work of the Goſpel to ſerve either mine own turne or the turnes of other earthly men out of it; and if I doe ſo, it is clear that I doe the worke of the Lord deceitfully, and the reward of an hypocrite will be given to me.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe grounds I have laid aſide all ſuch hidden things of darkneſſe, which I have ſeen ſway with ſome in the works of this nature; and therefore I am perſwaded I have herein a good conſcience towards God, which doth give mee confidence to caſt my ſelfe upon him, hoping for a bleſſing upon theſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, becauſe I looke to nothing but the doing of his will therein.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Motives diſſwading the publication of the enſuing Treatie.</note>Although then I may ingenuouſly confeſſe that I cannot ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally foreſee, as the times now are, and as moſt men ſtand affected to each other, that theſe motions will bee entertained (for they will ſute no ends of parties) but am rather apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that ſome who thinke themſelves wiſe, will laugh at mee, and at this diſcourſe; that moſt will not reliſh the motions, as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:116741:12"/>being ſomewhat out of the common way; that many will miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take my meaning, miſconſtrue my aime, and fall foul upon me perhaps for what they have miſconſtrued and miſtaken. And finally that few or none that ſeeme to bee Pillars, will heartily joyne and help to advance either theſe or other impartiall wayes of peace. (I ſay) although this may bee confeſſed;<note place="margin">Motives indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</note> yet I cannot forbeare to offer theſe thoughts unto you, both that I may diſcharge my conſcience towards God in the vow which I have made to proſecute Peace and Truth, by walking in the light (whatſoever ſome may or doe thinke of mee) and alſo that they may ſtand not onely for mee as a witneſſe, that I have ſought without partialitie the wayes as well of Truth as of Peace amongſt Brethren: but alſo riſe up in judgement (if you thinke good to publiſh them) againſt thoſe, who for wordly ends and ſelfe will (leſt they ſhould ſeeme to loſe ground) keep us at a diſtance, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our diviſions irreconciliable weaken our hands in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. Here I deſire not to bee miſtaken,<note place="margin">Why ſome do keep up our differences &amp; what guilt they draw upon themſelves thereby.</note> for I ſay not that any doe purpoſely intend (except they be the Emiſſaries of Jeſuits, of which too many are crept in amongſt us, in this diſſolution of all order) to make our diviſions irreconciliable; and to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our hands in the Goſpel: God forbid that any profeſſing the Goſpel ſhould bee thought ſo maliciouſly partiall. But this I I meane to ſay freely; that all ſuch as by the management or compoſure of theſe differences ſeeke any way rather to pleaſe themſelves, then in the ſpirit of meekneſſe to pleaſe others to their edification; I ſay of theſe, that they keepe us at a diſtance, that they widen our breaches, that they make our diviſions by little and little irreconciliable, and ſo they weaken both their owne, and their Brethrens hands in the Goſpel, and herein they not taking heed to themſelves, principally ſerve no bodies turne but Satans; and become his inſtruments moſt effectually to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power and prevalencie of the Truth. For it is Satans maine intereſt,<note place="margin">What Satans intereſt is in the difference of Miniſters.</note> above all others to ſet and keep the Miniſters of the Goſpel at variance amongſt themſelves, and diſagreeing in the way of their teſtimonie. For as long as they are kept ſo, he is ſure that the world, the wickedneſſe and greatneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the height of men will not fall before the throne of Jeſus Chriſt by their meanes. For if wee will look upon Satans
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:116741:13"/>kingdome, and conſider the wayes by which hee doth ſet up, and ſettle the Myſtery of iniquity in oppoſition to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God among men; wee ſhall perceive that one of them is this. That hee being the Prince of this world, doth eſtabliſh the government thereof by meere power and deceiving Policie. This government hee endeavoureth alwayes to put in the hands of ſuch men,<note place="margin">How Satan doth proſecute his intereſt.</note> who intend to make uſe thereof onely for their owne ends, which commonly are none other but greatneſſe and glory: for this cannot be denyed, that as the way of ſelf-deniall and humilitie is proper to Chriſt and his Kingdome: So the practiſes of men in ſeeking themſelves by power and policie are the works of Satans ſpirit, and of their owne corruption in order to his deſignes. And as the end of naturall men in the world, is onely to maintaine and inlarge themſelves, according to their owne will by their owne wayes; ſo the end of Satan in teaching them to manage their affaires, rather by power and policie, with an abſolute command, then by loving perſwaſions and convictions of the mind, with the evidence and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Truth, is onely to oppoſe in the ſoules of men the kingdome of Chriſt which is the light of Truth and the life of righteouſneſſe and holineſſe. For by theſe Chriſt is the King and Conquerour of ſoules; for by the light of Truth he ruleth in the underſtanding, and by the power of righteouſneſſe and holineſſe he ruleth in the will and affections of his ſubjects: if then Satan can gaine the opportunitie to ſet his miniſters aworke, who by the outward meanes of power and policie for their owne temporall ends, draw away mens minds from the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention unto, and the apprehenſion of Truth; and put out of their affections, the frame of meekneſſe, love and humility, wherein the life of righteouſneſſe and holineſſe doth ſtand; if (I ſay) he can get ſuch inſtruments, which hee can act either directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to draw mens mindes from the way of Chriſt by this way of his owne creating; then he hath clearely gained his end; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will be able to keepe mens underſtandings in darkneſſe; that is, in ignorance or doubt of the truth; and their will and affections in confuſion and diſorder, that is, in a frame oppoſit to the Law of God and his righteouſneſſe.<note place="margin">The direct meanes of erecting Satans kingdome.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now Satan will bee able to doe this directly by his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when hee can cauſe the profeſſion of ignorance to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:116741:13"/>ſet up and commended by authority, or commanded by a Law, or when hee can cauſe the knowledge and practiſe of any thing; beſides that which is ſetled by meer humane authority for certain ends of State to be made a crime puniſhable by death; by infamie or by any other penaltie, and when he can cauſe the whole frame and profeſſion of Religion to bee fitted onely to eſtabliſh that greatneſſe, wherein the glory of the outward ſtate and the authority of his inſtruments doth conſiſt. All which Satan doth with a high hand groſly in the Mahumetan, but with more ſubtiltie, and moſt compleatly in the Papall ſtate; and this hee is able to doe every where elſe in ſome competent meaſure whereſoever the maximes of abſolute dominion are maintained, and where the great Idoll of Politicians, which is called the reaſon or intereſt of State is onely worſhipped; and the true reaſon and intereſt of Conſcience and Religion is laid aſide and comparatively not at all regarded: I ſay whereſoever this courſe is followed, there Satan is able to oppoſe the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt directly.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The indirect means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Satan ſets up his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note>But where hee cannot attaine to this hee taketh the neereſt way hee can to gaine the ſame purpoſe indirectly, which is done by making all doctrines of Truth doubtfull, and all Goſpel Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances full of confuſion.</p>
            <p>Now to make all Truths doubtfull, hee raiſeth diſputes, and doth find out wayes to make them undecidable: and this he doth chiefly by the meanes of thoſe that ſhould bee the unanimous witneſſes of that Truth, which is called into queſtion, when they are diſunited amongſt themſelves. And to confound the Ordinances, he ſetteth every one promiſcuouſly upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration thereof in his owne way; not onely by giving a freedome unto all both to doe without controule what they pleaſe in ſuch matters, and to condemne and oppoſe every one that is not of their way; but alſo by diſanulling the authoritie by which all order ſhould bee ſetled in Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. And to bring all this to paſſe, his main endeavour is to cauſe the Miniſters of the Goſpel, either to bee ſubordinate unto his miniſters in all things at their will; or by variance of judgement amongſt themſelves, and difference of practiſes from each other to loſe their way; to neglect the rules of unitie and forbearance which the Word preſcribeth to uphold the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:116741:14"/>of Saints, which is their ſtrength; to breake the bonds of love and peace; and having ingaged them into quarrels, to bring them within the compaſſe of his reach, that is, to move them to act their controverſies, by the wayes of the power and policie of his kingdome for ſelf aimes: For if hee once can cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the ſimplicitie of their mindes ſo, that they minde not true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the dutie of being conformable to the Word in every thing, and to the ſpirituall aime of Chriſts walking in the world; and if he can ingage them into worldly deſignes to advance the ſame in a worldly way, hee hath gotten them cleerly within his reach; where he will endeavour to the utmoſt, firſt to cauſe them utterly forget and lay aſide the aime of their ſpirituall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Secondly, to allure them unto, and affect them with the appearance and glory of his dominion. Thirdly, to act them by the principles of outward feares and hopes to that which hee would have them doe; and when hee hath once gotten them thus farre under the power of this ſnare, he will be able with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſiſtance to carry them headlong amongſt themſelves to more and more uncharitableneſſe and unconſcionableneſſe of converſation, whereby breaches will bee multiplied and made irreconciliable. For although a difference ariſe but from a very ſmall and circumſtantiall matter amongſt them (as it doth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally fall out amongſt other men;) yet Satan aiming at them above all others, to get advantages againſt them, if he doth find them in ſuch a caſe; either without brotherly and charitable affections, or inclined to pleaſe themſelves; hee will bee able to worke upon them firſt jealouſies, and by jealouſies miſtakes, and by miſtakes a diſtance and ſtrangeneſſe, by reaſon of worldly aimes differently carried on; and when plots and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are come to ſome maturitie, croſſe courſes and mutuall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations will bee ſet on foot, reall injuries will bee offered; complaints and clamours will break forth, which in continuance make the diviſions of hearts paſt all remedy, and irreconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: becauſe it is not poſſible that men who aime at worldly matters, ſhould deny themſelves either the uſe of their wit and paſſions in the proſecution of their deſigne, or neglect the ſtrength which they have in hand, when they thinke it can ſerve their turne. For if they ſhould doe ſo, they ſhould ſeeme to quit their deſignes, and ſo loſe at once both the credit and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:116741:14"/>profit thereof, which to men that make uſe of their reaſon onely to compaſſe their owne will; and to that effect can employ both power and policie, is a thing altogether inſufferable, as being no leſſe contemptible then folly, and as hatefull as death.</p>
            <p>This I conceive to bee one of the myſteries of iniquity, by which Satan doth prevaile againſt the Miniſters of the Goſpel even againſt many men that are otherwiſe godly and able, but are not ſufficiently aware of his wiles, by which they are drawn from their owne and enſnared in his way, by which meanes their hands being weakned in their work, hee gaineth his end at leaſt indirectly by their infirmities and miſcarriages.</p>
            <p>Therefore all ſuch as are conſcionably ſenſible of their own frailties and of thoſe dangers, ſhould bee wakened from ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to become watchfull over their owne ſouls in theſe times of temptation: for amongſt the Proteſtant Churches, where, with the increaſe of knowledge, a true ſenſe of Chriſtian libertie is begotten in the minds of profeſſors; Satan hath none other way to fit to erect his kingdome as this is, of dividing the Miniſters: for which cauſe as wee ſee their diviſions daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, ſo the remedies ſhould be the more earneſtly thought upon, and offereed with freedome and tenderneſſe unto all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, but chiefly to thoſe who are neereſt in principles, and have leaſt cauſe to walke aſunder and be at a diſtance.</p>

               <note place="margin">The remedy againſt Satans way of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</note>Theſe remedies can bee none other, but the helpes to holy communion amongſt Miniſters in the proſecution of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all aimes, tending to the advancement of Truth and Peace. For the unitie of their ſpirits in the ſimplicitie of Truth is their ſtrength: and the evidence of grace without worldly wiſedome in their walking, will make them not onely invincible, but even irreſiſtible: becauſe the power of the Word of life, which is a two-edged Sword; and the armour of righteouſneſſe on the right hand and on the left (when they are handled in ſinceritie without all mixture of humane policie) will bee prevalent to <hi>make them triumph in Chriſt,</hi>

Whether (I ſay) from any, or from all of thoſe cauſes, the obſtruction doth ariſe, it is to mee a matter of no diſcouragement, but rather an occaſion to bee willing to appeare ſo as I am, in the preſence of God free from intereſts, and before men, without all pretence to wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſtrength and authoritie: That ſo farre as thoſe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall be found agreeable to the will of God, and ſutable to the conſcience of thoſe, whoſe wiſedome, ſtrength and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie is the obedience of Faith in performing their dutie, they may be entertained with ſingleneſſe of heart, and if ſo many of us as have freed our ſpirits from the bondage of feares and hopes in reſpect of outward matters, and have given our ſelves up to walke openly, by knowne and undeniable rules, and by the Law of unprejudicate love to bee without offence towards all, ſhould but reſolve upon this provocation, to lay the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of dutie repreſented therein, more ſeriouſly to heart then hitherto wee have done, and to ripen further thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame; who knoweth what God may work there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by?

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:116741:16"/>peace; that therein Chriſt is revealed to bee the Prince of love and peace; that none but his followers are capable of peace and unitie with God; and that amongſt men the true directions to live in love and peace one with another, are no where to bee found, but in his kingdome. Which being ſo, it will follow (notwithſtanding all theſe diviſions) that none ſhould more willingly undertake, nor can more profitably entertaine the thoughts of peace and unitie, for the compoſure of differences and ending of ſtrife amongſt men, then they whom God hath called to bee Preachers of his Goſpel, and whom hee hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to bee witneſſes of the Covenant of his grace and peace.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing all they to whom this Covenant is tendred, and by whom it is received through Faith; are bound to live in the unitie of Faith and Love, as being all one in Chriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates one to another by vertue of that Covenant: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall offer my ſelfe in the way of the heavenly calling (as one to whom the Goſpell is revealed, and to whom the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Jeſus in the Covenant of peace is committed) unto thoſe that are my Brethren in the ſame Miniſtery, humbly intreating them all, but chiefly ſuch as are moſt conſcionably wiſe in loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king rather to the will of God in the duties of their Miniſteriall function, then to the intereſts of a partie amongſt men, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and conſider with me, concerning the wayes of Unitie and Forbearance which they ought to mind amongſt themſelves, and acquaint their hearers withall, theſe three aſſertions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, that the ground wherefore they ought to profeſſe and practiſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitie and Forbearance one towards another, is the undeniable Law of Chriſtian Brotherhood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, that the Termes of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitie whereunto they have already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, are full and ſatisfactory, and that the termes of the Forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which they ſhould intend to practiſe are plain and eaſie to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and ſetled amongſt them.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. II. Of the firſt Aſſertion.</hi> Concerning the Law of Chriſtian Brotherhood, what it is, and whereunto it binds us.</head>
               <p>THe undeniable Law of Chriſtian Brotherhood is this, <hi>That all ſuch who are begotten of the ſame heavenly Father, by the ſame Word of Truth, in the ſame wombe of the free woman, the Jeruſalem which is above, are children of God, and truely brethren one to another in Chriſt, and having the ſame ſenſe of their relation one to another in Chriſt, and in all the chief Acts of their Religious profeſſion, the ſame rules to walke by, in the houſhold of faith, they are bound to acknowledge each other to be Brethren, and as Brethren to walk together in holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion for the adminiſtration and obſervation of Chriſts Ordinances in that whereunto they have attained, and to beare with one another in that whereunto they have not yet attained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſo it is, that ſuch as are acknowledged to bee Orthodox and godly Miniſters in this Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the ſame heavenly Father, by the ſame Word of Truth, (which is the doctrine of Faith revealed in the Scriptures) in the ſame wombe of the true Church, and have the ſame ſenſe of their relation unto Chriſt, and in all the chief Acts of their Religious profeſſion have the ſame Rules to walke by.</p>
               <p>Therefore it followeth undeniably, that they are truely Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren one to another in Chriſt, and that they are bound in conſcience to acknowledge each other to bee Brethren, and as Brethren to walke together in Holy Communion, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration and obſervation of Chriſts Ordinances in that whereunto they have attained, and to beare with one another in that whereunto they have not yet attained.</p>
               <p>And leſt any ſhould make a doubt of this Truth; the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition expreſſing the Law of Brotherhood, ſhall bee ſhewed from cleer places of Scripture, and the ſecond containing an
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:116741:17"/>application thereof unto the Miniſtery of this kingdome, ſhall bee verified of them by a more ſpeciall deduction of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars expreſſed therein.</p>
               <p>The places of Scripture wherein the Law of Brotherhood is cleerly manifeſted, are amongſt many others theſe.</p>
               <p>Chriſt ſaith to his Diſciples.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.8. <hi>All yee</hi> (namely, my Diſciples) <hi>are Brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>Whom hee</hi> (viz. the Father) <hi>did foreknow he alſo did predeſtinate to be conformed to the Image of his Sonne, that hee might bee the firſt borne amongſt many Brethren. Ergo,</hi> they are made all brethren unto Chriſt, and ſo Brethren to each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Of his owne will, hee</hi> (viz. the Father) <hi>begot us</hi> (viz. beleevers) <hi>by the Word of Truth. Ergo</hi> they all being chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the ſame Father and begotten of the ſame ſeed, are Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Job.</hi> 1.12. <hi>As many as received him</hi> (viz. Chriſt) <hi>to them hee gave power to become the Sonnes of God, even to them that beleeve in his name. Ergo,</hi> thoſe that receive Chriſt the ſame way, are alike Sonnes of God, and a like his Brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.12. <hi>I will declare</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>thy name unto my Brethren. Ergo,</hi> if Chriſt doth owne beleevers before God as his Brethren, ſhall they not own one another as ſuch?</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>By one ſpirit wee are all Baptized into one Body. Ergo,</hi> thoſe that have received the ſame Spirit are bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one body, and conſequently to bee united together as members one of another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6. <hi>There is one body and one Spirit, one hope of your calling; one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſme, one God and Father of all.</hi> If all theſe are one and the ſame in and to all beleevers, then all beleevers are united unto each other by them, and woe bee to ſuch that by their diviſions give the world cauſe to beleeve, that there is not one body, but many, nor one ſpirit, but many, nor one hope, nor one Lord, nor one Faith, nor one Baptiſme, but many, nor one God, but many.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.26. <hi>Jeruſalem which is above, is free, the mother of us all.</hi> If we are of one Father and Mother, then undeniably Brethren to each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>If there be any conſolation in Chriſt, if any comfort of love, if any fellowſhip of the Spirit, if any bowels of mercies, fulfill yee
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:116741:18"/>my joy,</hi> that <hi>ye bee like minded, having the ſame love, being of one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, of one mind. Ergo,</hi> ſuch as are in Chriſt and made partakers of the ſame ſpirit, are bound to have fellowſhip one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in their fellowſhip to impart to each other matters of full joy, by mutuall conſolation and comfort, by mutuall bowels and mercies; and to bee able to doe all this, they muſt ſtudie unitie amongſt themſelves, in the ſame mind and in the ſame love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Whereunto wee have attained already, let us walke by the ſame rule, let us mind the ſame thing. Ergo,</hi> Brethren, though not agreed in all things, yet are bound to profeſſe ſo farre as they are agreed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. <hi>Walke worthy of the vocation wherewith yee are called, with all lowlineſſe and meekneſſe, with long ſuffering, forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one another in love; endeavouring to keepe the unitie of the ſpirit in the bond of peace. Ergo,</hi> it is a part of our calling wherewith wee are called, to practiſe mutuall Forbearance; to the end, that Unitie and peace may bee preſerved, and ſuch as mind not the dutie of Forbearance, have therein renounced their calling.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Seeing you have purified your ſoules in obeying the Truth through the Spirit unto unfained love of the Brethren; ſee that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently. Ergo,</hi> one of the ends for which the Spirit is given to make us obedient to the Truth for the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of our ſoules, is this; that we ſhould affectionately expreſſe our love unto the Brethren. In theſe places wee ſee what the ground of the Law of Brotherhood is amongſt true Chriſtians, and what the duties thereof are.</p>
               <p>But if neither this Law, nor the duties thereof bee at all regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by thoſe that pretend to bee the chief of Chriſtians, is it not either a teſtimony againſt them, that they indeed are not what they pretend to be true, and faithfull Miniſters of the Goſpel of peace? or if they needs will be counted ſuch; is it not then before the world a teſtimony againſt the Goſpel it ſelf and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie, that it is not amongſt us what it is ſaid to bee, viz. the way of true love and peace? Therefore the great Character of true Chriſtians is to bee laid to heart ſeriouſly in theſe times of univerſall ſtrife, wherein all pretend more then others unto Chriſt, namely this which Chriſt hath given us himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.35. <hi>Hereby ſhall all men know that yee are my Diſciples if ye have
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:116741:18"/>love one to another.</hi> From whence muſt needs follow, that if yee have no love one to another, by this all men ſhall know, that ye are not his Diſciples. Therefore let us not deceive our ſelves, it is not the bare dogmaticall knowing of the truth that will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove us to be Chriſts Diſciples, there muſt bee a reall practiſe of it, and this practiſe is nothing elſe <hi>but to walke in love, as Chriſt hath loved us:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5, 1, 2.</note> For herein wee ſhall approve our ſelves <hi>to be deare children and followers of God,</hi> becauſe the <hi>new commandements</hi> which Chriſt hath given us, <hi>John</hi> 13.34. is this, <hi>That yee love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as I have loved you, that yee alſo love one another.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> his beloved Diſciple tells us, <hi>that wee know that wee have paſſed from death unto life, becauſe wee love the Brethren,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14. from whence hee doth in the ſame place inferre this conſequence: <hi>hee that loveth not his brother abideth in death.</hi> Let therefore no man flatter himſelfe with a vaine ſhew of the Truth of Chriſtianitie; this is an infallible Rule; None is a Chriſtian indeed and truth but hee that loveth the Brethren. If then we can make it appeare that the Miniſters of this kingdome are to eſteeme one another truely Brethren becauſe fully united unto Chriſt, and that by the Law of Chriſtian Brotherhood they are bound to make profeſſion of that unitie, and to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves one towards another, as it becommeth the Brethren of Jeſus Chriſt, and the brethren of each other in Chriſt; if (I ſay) wee can make theſe things appeare to bee an undoubted dutie, then wee may hope, that on the one hand ſuch as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be Chriſtians, and yet minde not at all this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing dutie, but continuing to walke offenſively in ſtrife with every one, diſhonour their profeſſion, will bee diſcovered to bee voyd of truth; and on the other hand ſuch as are ſincere will hee ſtirred up to ſhew themſelves zealous in the way of Truth, for the effectuall performance of the duties of Brotherly Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Forbearance towards all thoſe whom they are bound to acknowledge to belong to Jeſus Chriſt no leſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III. Of the ſecond Aſſertion.</hi> Concerning the Termes of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitie and Forbearance in generall.</head>
               <p>BY <hi>Vnitie</hi> wee meane the concurrence of mens judgments, affections and actions about the ſame thing in one and the ſame way, and for the ſame end.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Forbearance</hi> wee meane the refraining from uncharitable and unkindly affections and behaviours towards another in ſome things, although there bee ſome difference between us and him in judgement and in the way of acting about theſe things.</p>
               <p>By <hi>the termes of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitie and Forbearance</hi> wee underſtand all thoſe things, which determine the judgement and conſcience of a Chriſtian to the profeſſion and practiſe of theſe duties, as hee oweth them unto Chriſt and his members.</p>
               <p>As then the <hi>profeſſion and practiſe of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitie</hi> is grounded upon the Law of Brotherhood according to that of <hi>Abraham</hi> unto <hi>Lot:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 13.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Let there be noſtrife between me and thee, I pray thee, for wee bee Brethren:</hi> So <hi>the profeſſion and practiſe of Forbearance</hi> muſt bee grounded upon the Termes of ſome Unitie: for where there is no Unitie at all, if ever the diſunited parties come within the reach of one another, there no Forbearance can be expected; but where there is ſome Unitie, becauſe there alſo will be ſome concurrence, therefore there will needs follow thereupon ſome reſtraint of ſtrife, which is a Forbearance: for the affections of men are to bee anſwerable to the natures of things; as then things wholly oppoſit, cannot poſſibly agree to beare one with another, in that wherein their oppoſition doth lie, when they are are to act upon the ſame ſubject; no more then things agreeing can intend to oppoſe and deſtroy each other in that wherein their agreement doth lie: So it is with the Motions of mens ſpirits, both in the way of oppoſition and agreement, when either of theſe is fundamentall. For as in caſe of oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Apoſtle doth argue thus, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. <hi>What fellowſhip hath righteouſneſſe with unrighteouſneſſe? what communion hath light with darkneſſe?</hi> and <hi>what concord hath Chriſt with Balial?</hi> So in caſe of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:116741:19"/>agreement he argueth in like manner thus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.21.26. <hi>The eye cannot ſay to the hand, I have no need of thee, nor againe the head to the feet, I have no need of you. And whether one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with it, or one member be honoured, all the members rejoyce with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then all Forbearance from ſtrife and oppoſition, muſt proceed from the preſuppoſall of ſome Unitie; and where no Unitie is preſuppoſed, there can be no ſuch Forbearance: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before wee can ſpeake of the termes of Forbearance, wee muſt conſider firſt the termes of our agreement, to ſee how full and ſatisfactory theſe will be found.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Concerning the termes of Vnitie by themſelves what they are, why not regarded, and wherefore they ought to bee regarded.</head>
               <p>THe thing whereof wee are to make enquiry at this time is this, <hi>Whether yea or no the termes of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitie whereunto the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of this Kingdome which are counted Orthodox and godly have already attained, are not full and ſatisfactory to make them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge one another to be Brethren?</hi> If it can bee made out that the termes of their Unitie are ſuch, then it may bee inferred that they ought to behave themſelves each to other as it becommeth brethren, which to the grief of many is very ſlightly, or not at all performed. Now to reſolve the queſtion, let us conſider that which maketh men fully and ſatisfactorily brethren in Chriſt; whether it bee not truely found in them, although by many of them not at all regarded.</p>
               <p>Wee ſhall ſay then, that which formerly hath been aſſerted; <hi>If ſuch as are acknowledged to bee godly and Orthodox Miniſters in this kingdome are begotten of the ſame heavenly Father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What the termes of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly unitie are.</note> 
                  <hi>by the ſame Word of Truth, in the ſame true Church; and have the ſame ſenſe of their relation unto Chriſt, and in all the chief Acts of their Religious profeſſion have the ſame rules to walke by; then they have attained alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy unto that unitie, which is full and ſatisfactory to make them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge one another to bee Brethren.</hi> But ſo it is, that they <hi>are thus begotten, that they have this ſenſe of their Relation to Chriſt, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:116741:20"/>theſe Rules to walke by in their Religious profeſſion.</hi> Therefore <hi>the Vnitie whereunto they have already attained is full and ſatisfactory, to make them acknowledge one another to be Brethren.</hi> To theſe three heads then the particular termes of their Vnitie are to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>To the doctrine of Truth, which is the ſeed of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father begetting them to himſelf.</hi> 2. <hi>To the ſenſe of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unto Chriſt in the Church.</hi> 3. <hi>And to the Rules of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous walking;</hi> that if in every one of theſe the Unitie whereunto they have already attained bee found fully ſatisfactory to oblige them to a mutuall acknowledgment of Brotherhood; then the publick profeſſion thereof, may not any longer bee held in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe, as it is done by many to the great diſhonour of their Miniſtery, and of Chriſtianitie it ſelf. For it is a very ſad thing and extreamly deſtructive to the honour of true Chriſtianitie, to ſee thoſe men, that in all main things are fully agreed, and cannot bee otherwiſe eſteemed as to men, then truely ſincere and godly in their walking,<note place="margin">The cauſe why brotherhood is ſo little regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> not onely to drive oppoſit deſignes and courſes one to another in Religious matters, without juſt cauſe, but even hatefully, to ſeeme willing to deſtroy one another onely through want of charitie in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and for meer infirmities and incivilities in others, which the fundamentall Lawes and aimes of Chriſtianity oblige them to beare withall. And the more holy and heavenly theſe men ſeeme to bee in the wayes wherein they agree with their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; the more deſtructive and pernicious is the conſequence of their failing, in this kind, unto the Brotherhood of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie; becauſe it cauſeth every ſmall matter of difference to bee heightned ſo in the mindes of their followers, that all the grounds of Unitie, of Love, of Forbearance and of mutuall edification, are not onely weakned, but directly caſt off and diſregarded.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">See forth in the example of <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohns</hi> diſciples.</note>This doth put me in mind of the failing of <hi>John</hi> and <hi>James</hi> which is mentioned, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. ver. 53. <hi>till</hi> 57. Chriſt was going with them towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in his way hee paſſeth by a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and they perceiving that his face was towards <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> would not receive him, and give him civill entertainment: whereat <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were ſo highly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that they would have revenged this injury, with their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſtruction by fire from heaven: but Chriſt did rebuke them,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:116741:20"/>and told them two things; firſt, <hi>ye know not</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>what manner of ſpirits ye are of.</hi> Secondly, <hi>The Sonne of man is not come to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them.</hi> As if hee had ſaid, Your ſpirit is diſtempered, and you diſcerne not that Satan hath caught you in his ſnare, and you remember not, that my aime is to ſave mens lives; and not with vengeance to right my ſelfe againſt them to their utter deſtruction. From this Hiſtorie wee may obſerve theſe Truths.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is incident even to godly men to bee tranſported with zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous diſtempers wherein Satan doth take hold of them.</hi> For it cannot bee denyed but that <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were truely godly and faithfull Diſciples of Chriſt; and that here they are tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a zeal, which is not godly, but devilliſh, is altogether alſo undeniable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That the devilliſh zeale of godly men, may ariſe in them from their love to the Truth, and from a ſenſe of the indignities done unto it, which they cannot brooke at the hands of unworthy men:</hi> for it is cleer that nothing could occaſion this exceſſe in <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ſo much as their great love and high eſteeme of Chriſts worth, and the injurie which they thought was done to him and themſelves by ſuch men as they thought Samaritanes to bee; <hi>viz.</hi> men of corrupt Principles in Religion, Schiſmaticks and unworthy of their ſocietie:<note place="margin">Iohn 4.9.</note> 
                  <hi>For the Iewes had no dealings with the Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That this love to the Truth and ſenſe of the indignities done to it by unworthy men, may bee mixed with the ſpirit of ſelf-love, which is indiſcernible unto them that are led thereby.</hi> For it may bee conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured, that although the Diſciples loved their Maſter ſincerely, and thought him highly affronted by the Samaritanes, that would not give him lodging-roome; yet that they ſhould not have been ſenſible at all of their owne inconveniencie of not being refreſhed with meat when they were hungry, and of the affront done to themſelves, not to bee civilly entertained when they were wearie, is not at all likely, but it may bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably gathered from circumſtances, that the diſappointment of their expectation (meſſengers being ſent before to make ready for them) when they were weary &amp; hungry, did heighten both their diſcontent, and the ſenſe of the injury done unto their Maſter.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:116741:21"/> 4 <hi>That even godly men, when they are inſnared into paſſions occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by injuries, will for ſmall matters of private concernment, be ſometimes ſet upon thoughts of revenge, take up deſtructive reſolutions, and thereby forget the maine end of their profeſſion;</hi> for wee ſee all this in the Apoſtles, and by Chriſts reproof of them, and his reaſon taken from the end of his Miniſtery, whereunto all his and their actions were to bee ſubordinate, it appeares that they are put in minde of what they had forgotten.</p>
               <p>Now as it was with <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> in this caſe, ſo it is with many godly men in like caſes. For in theſe times of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, wherein diviſions are beightned to the utmoſt, it doth often fall out, that men being of different parties, for farre leſſer cauſes then Jewes and Samaritanes were divided; yet look upon one another with no leſſe animoſitie then did the Jewes upon the Samaritanes, and the Samaritanes upon the Jewes; that is, with ſo much prejudice, that if they find a man but loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king towards that partie to which they have ſet themſelves in oppoſition, as the Samaritanes found Chriſts face ſet towards <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> they will bee ready to deale with him as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans dealt with Chriſt, and his Diſciples, refuſe him ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilitie, uſe him inhumanely, and perhaps offer injuries both in deeds and words. Theſe injuries will ſometimes bee taken as reflecting upon the Truth of the profeſſion; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon the juſtice of the cauſe and the innocencie of the partie which we favour; and if withall (as oft-times it falleth out) ſome private concernment of our owne is mixed with the publick intereſt; that will mainly heighten the ſenſe of thoſe injuries, and tranſport us unto ſome exceſſe of zeale: For when any degree of paſſion for ſelf concernment doth meet in our affection with any object of true zeale, and a ground of publick intereſt, to mixe withall and raiſe it ſelf upon; then it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a mightie one, and a giant-like paſſion; as when in the firſt world,<note place="margin">Gen 6. 2, 3, 4.</note> the <hi>Sonnes of God came in into the faireſt of the daughters of men, and thoſe bore children unto them, they were mighty ones and men of renoune:</hi> ſo it falleth out here, that in the Spirits of men, mighty reſolutions and purpoſes of high revenge are begotten upon ſuch occaſions: and when Satan doth finde us in any ſuch diſtemper, hee hath a fit opportunitie to in fuſe his poyſon into cur aimes to cauſe us forget the end of our ſpirituall calling which is not to deſtroy but to ſave the lives of men, by rectify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:116741:21"/>them and building them up in the Spirit of meekneſſe and of love, with all long-ſuffering and Forbearance. Thus wee may ſee by daily experience, that when humane parties are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, (for in Chriſtianitie there is none) and when inhumane injuries are mutually offered about religious concernments, it is one of the hardeſt things in the world, to prevent or to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the diſtempers which ariſe from thence; but yet wee muſt ſay in this caſe what Chriſt faith in another;<note place="margin">Matth. 19.26.</note> 
                  <hi>With men this is impoſſible, but with God all things are poſſible.</hi> Therefore I beleeve that God is able both to prevent and rectifie ſuch exceſſes of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, two wayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The remedy of theſe diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</note> 
                  <hi>Firſt, by wakening our conſciences effectually towards himſelf in min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding us of the end and way of our miniſteriall function, as it is in Chriſt:</hi> that is to ſay, to teach us to aime at nothing but to bee conformable unto Chriſt, by minding the ſame thing which he did mind towards God, and by walking in the ſame way, wherein hee is gone before us, to glorifie his Father in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, by ſetting a ſpirituall edge upon our affections towards men; not to conſider them after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit, as they are, or may be in Chriſt Ieſus our Brethren.</hi> That is to ſay, to walke in all things towards them, by the Law of Chriſtian Brotherhood, and make the poſitive rules thereof beare the onely ſway in all our reſolutions. For by theſe principles, and by theſe alone, wee ſhall bee enabled both to free our ſelves from the trouble which otherwiſe will fall upon us for ſmall and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matters of difference in judgement and practiſe, and alſo to cauſe all outward concernments fall flat before the Majeſtie of Gods will in the duties of peace and Brotherhood, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe wee ſhall bee found void of all ſtrength to doe any ſuch thing, and every little trifle will make us fall from our own ſted faſtneſſe. Whence it is, that becauſe theſe principles and duties have been and are diſreſpected in our work of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt thoſe that undeniably are Brethren; therefore the ſcandalls which are given to the weak, and obſerved by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, to diſcredit our proceedings, are multiplied, to the ſadding of the hearts of all that are godly; nor is there any other way imaginable as I conceive, relating to conſcience, fit to remove them, and to heale the breaches which follow thereupon, but
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:116741:22"/>this, to manifeſt unto thoſe that are faithfull to their principles and conſcionable in the Miniſtery, that the relation wherein God hath ſet them one towards another, is a brotherly Unitie, which in it ſelf is ſo full and fatisfactory, and by his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is ſo ſtrict and obligatory, that whoſoever doth not take up the profeſſion thereof, and endeavour to obſerve the duties belonging thereunto, ſhall not only be found a tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour, but even inexcuſable and unworthy of the name of a Chriſtian. For this cauſe I have laid to heart this ſubject of Brotherly Unitie and Forbearance, that if God permit, it may cleerly, though briefly bee laid open to ſome of the Miniſtery, that ſeeme wholly to neglect the conſideration thereof. For my ſcope is onely to name the chief heads of their agreement, to ſhew how ful &amp; ſatisfactory it is in my opinion to ſettle the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and practiſe of a Chriſtian Brotherhood between them: (offering this, that if any ſhall make a ſcruple of the Truth of that, which ſhall bee afferted concerning this matter in brief; that a large deduction and demonſtration in due time ſhall bee made thereof) to the end that ſuch who heighten matters of ſtriſe amongſt Brethren, that multiply controverſies unadviſedly, for ſmall matters; and that walke by dividing Principles rather then by the ſpirit of Unitie in the Goſpel of Peace, may have cauſe to reflect upon themſelves; to conſider ſeriouſly of the errour of their way, and ſhape their courſe otherwiſe then hitherto they have done, leſt happily they bee found guilty <hi>of that contentiouſneſſe and diſobedience unto the Truth,</hi> whereunto the Apoſtle hath ſadly threatned a heavie judgement <hi>of wrath and indignation, of Anguiſh and Tribulation,</hi> in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Rom.

               <p>FOraſmuch as I am very confident, that the Miniſters of both ſides are fully convicted of each others Orthodoxy in all thoſe Truths which containe not <hi>onely the ſubſtance and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Chriſtianitie,</hi> but alſo all <hi>profitable matters unto edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> therefore I ſhall aſſert the ſulneſſe and ſatisfactorineſſe of this Unitie briefly in a few propoſitions, which I am ſure doe containe much more <hi>as to the agreement in doctrinals;</hi> and no leſſe <hi>as to the agreement in their relation unto Chriſt and his Church,</hi> then is requiſite to make up a Brotherly Vnitie.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, it is undeniably evident, that they all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and receive <hi>the ſame holy Scriptures of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> to bee the onely Word of God, outwardly given both to the Church in generall, and to all men in particular, as the onely rule of Faith and Obedience, which in it ſelfe and to all beleevers is cleer and ſufficient for the attainement of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for their direction in all good workes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they all agree that in doubtfull places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the <hi>Interpretation thereof is to bee taken from the undoubted analogie</hi> (that is, the proportion) <hi>of Faith,</hi> which is in other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Thirdly, it is evident, that they all beleeve unanimoufly, that in theſe holy Scriptures is revealed unto us, that <hi>there are three bearing witneſſe in beaven, the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt, and that theſe three are one,</hi> and the onely true and living God, of whom the true knowledge is life eternall.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they all agree to profeſſe and <hi>teach that wee have hope to bee juſtified and ſaved by Faith onely in God through Ieſus Chriſt alone;</hi> who according to the Scriptures is the Meſſias pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the Fathers, and ſent into the world; and who being the onely begotten Sonne of the Father from eternitie, was in time made fleſh, a true man, like unto us (ſinne excepted) in all things; and be comming a Mediator between God and us, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

               <p>Fifthly, they all agree fully in this, <hi>That there hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, that now there is, and ever ſhall bee unto the end of the world amongſt men a true Church,</hi> wherein God is worſhipped according to his will in ſpirit and truth, by the Ordinances of his owne appointment.

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Concerning the termes of unitie in the chief Acts of our Religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</head>
               <p>OUr Religious profeſſion is here taken notice of, as it <hi>is publick,</hi> and doth oblige us to ſtand in ſome relation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others through the communion of Saints.</p>
               <p>The chief Acts thereof are foure:</p>
               <p>The firſt is, <hi>of profeſſors as they ſtand ſingle by themſelves</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the worſhip of God in publick.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, <hi>of profeſſors as they ſtand united unto a congregation,</hi> in reference to the viſible conſtitution and government thereof.</p>
               <p>The third is, <hi>of ſeverall Congregations</hi> in reference to their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall aſſociation</p>
               <p>The fourth is, <hi>of the Officers and Rulers of theſe ſeverall Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,</hi> in reference to their intereſt in each other, and the joynt adminiſtration of their publick charges.</p>
               <p>If then in all theſe acts, the fundamentall rules whereby they are to be directed and managed, are fully and ſatisfactorily the ſame, and not unknowne but rather acknowledged by the profeſſors of both ſides; it will follow, that both ſides ought to look upon each other therein as upon Brethren, and practiſe the duties of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:116741:24"/>Brotherhood one to another which are anſwerable unto this acknowledgment. But if not withſtanding this unitie and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in theſe rules, and in the acknowledgment thereof, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are neglected, then the ſentence of the Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> 4.16. is to be laid to heart; <hi>To him that knoweth to doe good and doth it not, to him it is ſinne.</hi> And that of our Saviour which is more full and plain, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.47. <hi>The ſervant which knew his Lords will and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared not himſelf, neither did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> Now that in theſe Acts of the profeſſion, the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall rules obliging us unto holy Communion are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged on both ſides to bee the ſame, will appeare in theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars.</p>

                  <p>VVHen wee looke upon <hi>Profeſſors</hi> (ſuch namely as wee have already deſcribed to bee beleevers of the doctrin forenamed; and to have that relation unto Chriſt and his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which hath been formerly mentioned;) when I ſay we look upon theſe Profeſſours <hi>as ſingle,</hi> that is, as ſtanding by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not embodied into any particular ſocietie; yet we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to exempt them by this notion from either a viſibilitie of their profeſſion, or a compliance in that wherein they ought to concurre with other Chriſtians. For they are to bee counted <hi>ſingle;</hi> not as if they might take up a <hi>ſingle and fungular way of proſeſſing Chriſt by themſelves alone, which is neither common nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible unto other Chriſtians,</hi> but they are to bee counted ſingle <hi>onely as they are men, not engaged as yet, unto any particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to bee members thereof profeſſedly.</hi> Suppoſe then a man to be a true Chriſtian and a meere ſtranger to all the men and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of a Nation, where he findeth the name of Chriſt known and publikely profeſſed by ſome, and not at all known and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſled by others, the queſtion may bee concerning him, three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. 1. <hi>Whether hee ſhould make himſelfe known to bee a profeſſor yea or no?</hi> 2. <hi>How be ſhould manifeſt his Profeſſion?</hi> viz. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yea or no hee ſhould not joyne with others in the Acts of publick worſhip?</hi> And 3. <hi>What the Acts of publick ſervice and worſhip are, whereunto bee ſhould joyne, if he ſhould apply himſelf to other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:116741:24"/>
                  <p> Now in the anſwer to theſe three queſtions I ſuppoſe that both ſides will fully agree upon theſe rules as a directory for him to walk by, in ſuch a caſe, and to the firſt the anſwer is this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Although a man ſtand ſingle, and is not embodied into any paer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioular ſociety; yet he ought to make it appeare unto the world and to other Profeſſors, that be is a Chriſtian, that is, be ought to appeare in publick as a Profeſſor of Chriſtianitie.</hi>

                  </p>

                  <p n="2">2. To the ſecond queſtion, whether yea or no, hee ſhould not joy ne with others in the Acts of publick worſhip? the anſwer will be affirmative thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee that ſhould appeare in publick as a Profeſſor of Chriſtianitie, ought to aſſemble himſelf together to call upon the name of God in Chriſt, with ſuch as meet to that effect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The grounds of this rule are theſe places of Scripture.</p>

                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:116741:25"/> 3. To the third queſtion, What the Acts of the Profeſſion are in the publick ſervice and worſhip whereunto hee ſhould joyne, if he ſhould apply himſelfe unto other Profeſſors. The anſwer will bee twofold.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is concerning <hi>the Acts of ſervice, belonging unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints,</hi> wherein all Chriſtians are bound to joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as Chriſtians without reſpect of perſons, or ſocieties grounded upon particular intereſts; and it is that which the Apoſtle doth command, <hi>Timoth.</hi> 2. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.22. <hi>To follow righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, faith, charitie and peace, with all ſuch as call upon the Lord out of a pure heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond concerning the <hi>publick Acts of divine worſhip in the aſſemblies,</hi> whereunto Profeſſors ſhould reſort; of which theſe poſitions will be acknowledged by all.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That the main and principall Acts of publick worſhip are the preaching and publiſhing of the Word of God, and the offering up of Prayers and thanksgivings unto God:</hi> which will bee found a truth in theſe places of Scripture; <hi>Act.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.13, 14, 15, 16, 17. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>per totum,</hi> and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.11.16. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That theſe Acts ſhould not bee ordinarily performed by every one that will put himſelf forward to ſpeake, but by ſome that are knowne to have the gift of prophecying, and are approved; ſet apart, and called to that dutie.</hi> Which will be evidenced in theſe places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.18.27, 28, 29. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34.40. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8.11, 12. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1, 2.10 and <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5, 6.10, 11. <hi>Hel.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3, 4. and 1 Pet. 4.10.17.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, from the nature of diviſions, or intentions to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, amongſt Brethren, which the Apoſtle doth condemne as the fruit of a carnall mind. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17, 18.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe this intention is contrary to the requeſt of Chriſt in his prayer unto the Father, where hee deſires that all beleevers may bee made perfect in one, <hi>John</hi> 17.23. and if all beleevers, then all Congregations of beleevers.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>If ſeverall Congregations may not intend to ſtand, as by themſelves, and walke as ſeparate from one another, in the adminiſtration of Chriſts Ordinances, which they have received by a common rule, and are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:116741:27"/>before the world in publick as one body in Chriſt,</hi> then it will follow cleerly, <hi>that it is farre leſſe lawfull unto them in the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of matters tending to mutuall edification, in ordinary or in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and weighty matters, of common and neceſſary concernment; to ſtand and walke by themſelves alone without a due reſpect unto their Brethren, and ſome tie of aſſociation towards their neighbour Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</hi> So that I take this to bee an undeniable principle and maxime of Brotherly aſſociation in Churches. <hi>That nothing which with conveniencie, and to the benefit of the Goſpel it ſelfe, or to the edification of others therein, can bee done unitedly and joyntly, ought to bee done dividedly and ſeparately.</hi> For when Chriſt doth pray for a perfect union of all beleevers which may worke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the world a beleef that the Father hath ſent him;<note place="margin">Ioh. 17.23.</note> I cannot conceive that hee doth meane any thing leſſe, then ſuch an aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation which may reach unto all the Acts of his worſhip, and the viſible adminiſtration of all duties and ordinances belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Kingdome. For nothing, but ſuch an union profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly maintained in his name, is able to convince the world finally, that hee is come from the Father. Thus farre then, or rather thus neer, the Congregations ought to bee aſſociated if it bee poſſible; and that it is poſſible and will bee effected in due time, is certaine, becauſe Chriſt hath prayed that it ſhould bee, for the manifeſtation of his name unto the world; and the Father cannot deny him this requeſt. Hitherto I have inſiſted upon that which I conceive is, or will bee aſſented unto by all, upon the undeniable grounds of brotherly communion. Now I ſhall offer the other Propoſitions which for a more part cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar accommodation of differences have been aſſented unto,<note n="*" place="margin">See alſo the papers of the Divines of the Aſſembly given to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation lately publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Pag. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 &amp; p 29. 30, 31. and elſewhere.</note> and are agreed upon by ſome leading men of both ſides as followeth.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>All profeſſors, whether ſingle or in a body, are bound in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to give an account of their wayes to their Brethren, or to any that ſhall require it of them, and that not arbitrarily but as a dutie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God to be: obſerved.</hi> Mr. Burroughs <hi>Irenicum, pag.</hi> 43.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Concerning the admiſſion of members, which come from one Congregation into another, to bee thereunto diſtinctly aſſociated, becauſe this doth reflect commonly upon ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular intereſts of men, wherein the rules of holy communion are not taken notice of, therefore offences are frequently given
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:116741:27"/>and taken up in this matter, which to prevent theſe agreements have been offered as a remedie thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>That no Congregation ſhould bee gathered and made up of the Members of other ſetled Congregations, except they bee in an orderly way diſmiſſed by theſe with whom they were aſſociated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>That no member comming from another Church with which wee are in brotherly Communion, ſhall be admitted to become a diſtinct mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our ſocietie, till the Church from which hee commeth bee made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his purpoſe to aſſociate with us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>That none who is ſaid to belong to that neighbourhood or aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is called a Pariſh, (though hee doth not profeſſe himſelfe a member in that way) ſhall bee received as a member of any diſtinct Congregation, untill the Officers thereof have enquired concerning his life and converſation of thoſe that are Rulers of the ſaid neighbourhood, and of the Congregations neereſt unto his habitation, to whom it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee may have had ſome relation, or which may have taken notice of his wayes and profeſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One of the chief myſteries and originall cauſes of our mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold diviſions doth lie in this outward circumſtantiall manner of the aſſociation of members into a Congregation, and the reaſon hereof as I take it, is, partly becauſe men naturally ſeek rather to pleaſe themſelves in the ſatisfaction of ſome humors of their owne, then to edifie others, partly becauſe the true uſe of Chriſtian libertie, and the relation wherein all true profeſſors ſtand one to another in Chriſt, is either not underſtood, or not minded; in compariſon of ſome circumſtantials of our owne coining to our ſelves, upon any one of which wee uſe to lay more weight then upon all the fundamentalls of Chriſts appointment.</p>
                  <p>And till his grace and good ſpirit diſcover and worke out this ſelf pleaſing humour, wee cannot hope for peace and unitie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in any thing, although our agreement be never ſo funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall in all things.</p>

                     <hi>Sect. IV.</hi> Of the Officers and Rulers of ſeverall Congregations, and their aſſociation.</head>
                  <p>THe Officers of every Congregation are under a twofold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of unitie to each other: Firſt, <hi>as they are Profeſſors:</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:116741:28"/>Secondly, <hi>as they are Officers,</hi> that is, <hi>ſpecially intruſted with a charge in the profeſſion:</hi> As they are Profeſſors, they are neerer in Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood then as they are Officers. For their profeſſion doth give them an immediate intereſt into Chriſt, and to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in him: but their Office doth give them no intereſt either in him or in each other, further then they are true to the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: whence it followeth that except they bee aſſociated in the myſticall body of Chriſt, they cannot be aſſociated in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery thereof. It followeth alſo further, that the relation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſtand to each other as Chriſtians, being the onely foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their Brotherhood; all the other relations, which are miniſteriall, muſt yeeld and bee ſubordinate thereunto So that all the bonds, which may ſettle their aſſociation in the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, muſt be intended no further then they ſerve to advance and confirme the brotherhood and aſſociation, which is ſetled upon the truth of Chriſtianitie. For if any combination of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters bee framed otherwiſe, or to any other end, then to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the fundamentalls of Faith, and to increaſe the fruits of true Chriſtianitie in holineſſe and love: it will beget nothing elſe but a Papacie, becauſe the root of the Papall Hierarchie, and the foundation whereupon that myſtery of iniquitie was raiſed in the Church, was nothing elſe but <hi>the aime of an aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of Church Officers ſubordinating the profeſſion to their places, and making uſe of the fundamentals of truth, to ſet up themſelves above others:</hi> for it may bee evidenced, that all the ſuperſtitious devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and politick practiſes of Popery to blind men, and by an implicit faith to keepe them in ſubjection, reſolve themſelves at laſt into this principle and aime, of ſetting up themſelves above Chriſtianitie in the hearts of men, which is properly the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. Therefore it cannot bee deni d, that they ſpring originally from hence, ſeeing every thing is ultimately reſolved into that, whereof it was firſt begotten. From all which I draw this concluſion in brief, <hi>that all aſſociations of Church-Officers or of any other publick Officers of what kind ſoever, who ſubordinate not themſelves, and the intereſt which they have in each other by their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and by their aſſociations, unto the ends of Chriſtianitie, to exalt the unitie thereof, that Chriſt may bee ſeene above all therein; but ſeeke to make the way of Chriſtianitie, or the aſſociation of Chriſtians ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the advantage of their places above others, are Papall and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:116741:28"/>
                  <p> Let then all parties looke to their aimes in their aſſociations, whether they bee called Independent or Presbyteriall Aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and whether they bee ſetled upon Epiſcopall or Eraſtian principles; and let all Magiſtrates looke to their intereſts and wayes of proſecuting the ſame by their aſſociations; whether they bee Democraticall, Ariſtocraticall, Parliamentary or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall, whatſoever their character, frame, or modell is, as to the matter of circumſtantials, which is all that ordinarily men as men looke after: Let (I ſay) all theſe Officers of each kind, or ſuch as out of the mixt multitude, upon the ruines of others, doe thruſt themſelves into places of truſt and profit, and ſeeke to ſtrengthen themſelves by combinations of their owne framing; (I ſay againe) let all theſe looke well to it, every one in his particular aſſociation, if their whole aime and the frame of their ſociety bee not, to ſubordinate themſelves and their combinations and confederacies to the ſetting up of that union, which is eſſentiall unto the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and which alone ſhall laſt eternally; they ſhall bee utterly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to pieces without all remedy. For the Word of God by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> cannot faile, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8, 9, 10. which ſaith, <hi>Aſſociate your ſelves ye people, and ye ſhall bee broken in peeces, gird your ſelves and ye ſhall bee broken in pieces, gird your ſelves and ye ſhall bee broken in pieces: take counſell together and it ſhall come to nought, ſpeake the word and it ſhall not ſtand. For God is with us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Prophet ſpeaking in the name of the Church doth provoke the whole world, and bids the people thereof a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that though they joyne all in one, and gird themſelves with all their ſtrength and all their counſells and reſolutions bee brought to full maturitie, yet that they ſhall be without effect, that they ſhall bee broken to pieces in their aſſociations, and diſappointed in their counſels, and reſolutions, becauſe God is with his Church, as the head of their aſſociation. Thus wee ſee that the Spirit of God doth blow upon all the deſignes of men ſo farre as they are not ſubordinate unto God: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in men are not ſubordinate, they are oppoſit unto him, and hee will certainly be ſtronger then his oppoſits.</p>
                  <p>And if the Queſtion bee made concerning the Church, and thoſe that belong thereunto, what their dutie is in times of trouble and feare when all the world is providing for their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:116741:29"/>ſafetie, with confederacies, ſtrength and counſell? (I ſay) if ſuch a queſtion bee made, the anſwer will bee found in the following words of the Prophet from <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. till the end of the Chapter, whereof this is the ſumme.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that they ſhould take heed leſt they bee drawne and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged into worldly confederacies, for humane feares; but that <hi>they ſhould ſanctifie God alone in their hearts, and make him their feare, verſ.</hi> 11, 12, 13. becauſe the Lord will bee to all thoſe that doe ſo, <hi>a ſanctuary, but to others a rock of offence, verſ.</hi> 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that they ſhould <hi>bind up the teſtimony and ſeale the Law amongſt the Diſciples of the Lord;</hi> that is to ſay, that they who are taught of God (for theſe are his Diſciples) ſhould make the teſtimony of Jeſus the onely bond of their unitie, and that the ſeale of this bond ſhould bee their obedientiall ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion unto the Law of God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that they ſhould arme themſelves with patience <hi>to waite for the Lords comming, who is hid from the eyes of the world,</hi> and with reſolution to appeare before him, although the world doth <hi>wonder at them, verſ.</hi> 17.18.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, when in caſes of difficultie men ſhall bee deſtitute of counſell, and not know what to doe; then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult <hi>onely with the Law and the Teſtimony, and not to betake themſelves to any other Oracle, verſ.</hi> 19, 20. and whoſoever doth not follow this advice ſhall bee <hi>driven into utter deſpaire, verſ.</hi> 21, 22.</p>
                  <p>Thus wee ſee what the counſell of God is concerning humane aſſociations; what the iſſues thereof will bee, and what the way is to preſerve our ſoules from that deſpaire which doth attend thoſe that forſake God, and ſubordinate not their counſels and aſſociations to his will.</p>
                  <p>This then will bee our wiſedome to take this warning, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee bee Profeſſors or Officers: but chiefly this muſt bee the ground of the miniſteriall aſſociation, in reference to their charges; to make uſe thereof onely for the furtherance of holy Communion in the profeſſion of Chriſtianitie. And although I cannot ſay that it is ſo amongſt the Combinations which now are on foot, yet I am ſure that theſe grounds will bee aſſented unto by all that are taught of God; and that their practiſe may bee anſwerable thereunto, I ſhall offer that whereunto both ſides doe agree, and which without contradiction will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:116741:29"/>to enter them upon a <hi>Miniſteriall correſpondencie both for the advancement of true Brotherhood in Chriſtianity amongst themſelves, as alſo for the preſervation of themſelves and of their flocks, from partaking of other mens ſinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For to theſe two heads, the matters of agreement in the point of aſſociation may be referred.</p>
                  <p>Of the firſt I ſhall offer theſe Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>The Officers of Siſter Churches, making profeſſion of their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood in Chriſt, ſhould deſire to advance each other to perfection; and to that effect ſhould have frequent meetings for brotherly conferences,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Malach.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>The chief ends of their meetings and conferences ſhould bee, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the unitie of the Spirit whereunto they have attained; to make it more compleat in love, and to gaine others to concurre with them by the truth therein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>They ſhould for theſe ends ſet themſelves in a way to make their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences effectually conſcionable, conſtant, without interruption and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderlineſſe;</hi> which way may bee ſetled upon theſe grounds.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>upon a voluntary engagement, freely entered into,</hi> which ſhould containe theſe heads: that ſeeing they acknowledge one another fellow-members of the body of Chriſt, and fellow-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the ſame Maſter, in the ſame houſhold of Faith, for the accompliſhment of his will; that therefore they are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to give to each other the right hand of fellowſhip in doing the worke of their Miniſtery,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. ver. 1 — 11.</note> that they will entertaine bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly meetings and conferences to that end: and that they will never ſuffer any circumſtantiall differences of opinions or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, to breake their aſſociation or hinder their ordinarily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed meetings and conferences.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>upon ſome rules and orders which in like manner every one ſhould aſſent unto freely, and expreſly, ſo farre as hee doth finde himſelf convicted of the juſtice and equitie thereof,</hi> the ſubſtance of which orders may bee this. That in their conferences confuſion ſhall bee avoyded, that an equall and orderly freedome of ſpeech ſhall bee yeelded unto all, and that a libertie of diſſenting unpartially upon reaſons alledged ſhall bee given unto every one.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>upon the meanes of ſome correſpondency betweene ſeverall aſſociations:</hi> for ſeeing all that are willing to aſſociate, cannot
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:116741:30"/>poſſibly meet at the ſame conference<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, by reaſon of the diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of places and mens different occaſions, therefore ſeverall knots and companies of aſſociats will ariſe, and leſt they being unacquainted with one anothers wayes, take diſagreeing reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and miſtake one anothers meanings therein; for this cauſe, ſome meanes of correſpondencie between diſtant aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is to bee agreed upon for the communication of matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the advancement of truth in love between them.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto wee have looked upon the firſt head wherein there is an <hi>agreement in the Rules by which the aſſociation is to be framed for mutuall edification;</hi> now follow the matters of agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ſecond head, <hi>which is the uſe of their aſſociation for the preſervation of themſelves and of their flocks from partaking in other mens ſinnes.</hi> Of which I ſhall ſet downe almoſt word by word that which I finde granted by Mr. <hi>Burroughs in his Ironicum or Heart Diviſions, pag.</hi> 43. which I conceive the Brethren of the other ſide will fully aſſent unto, and ought to lay as a ſufficient ground of aſſociating in a brotherly way: His words are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>They</hi> (viz. the diſſenting Brethren) <hi>acknowledge that Synods of other Miniſters and Elders about them, are an Ordinance of Jeſus Chriſt, for the helping of the Church againſt Errors, Schiſmes and Scandals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>That theſe Synods may by the power they have from Chriſt admoniſh men or Churches in his name, when they ſee evills continuing in or grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Church, and their admonitions carry with them the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>As there ſhall becauſe they may declare men or Churches to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters of the Faith; or otherwiſe according to the nature of the offence; to ſhame them before all the Churches about them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>They may by a ſolemne act in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, refuſe any further communion with them till they repent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>They may declare, and that alſo in the name of Chriſt, that theſe erring people or Churches, are not to bee received into followſhip with any the Churches of Chriſt; nor to have communion one with another in the Ordinances of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To theſe Propoſitions, if a full aſſent bee given, as by many no doubt there is; I cannot imagine what ſhould hinder, or may obſtruct the profeſſion of their unitie and a concurrence to ſettle their aſſociations for a joynt and mutuall aſſiſtance in the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:116741:30"/>worke of brotherly preſervation of each other, from the guilt of other mens ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Thus then wee ſee that the termes of our brotherly unity are full and ſatisfactory in all theſe reſpects, and if notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all this we are divided in our wayes, and in our affections unwilling to practiſe any thing joyntly, which is ſutable to theſe acknowledged principles; are wee not guilty before God and men of the neglect of a fundamentall dutie in Chriſtianitie, and that inexcuſably? ſurely wee will be found ſo, if wee ſet not our ſelves in another way then hitherto wee have walked in one towards another.</p>

               <p>Firſt, that God hath commanded his children and ſervants both to beare one anothers burthens, and to beare with one anothers infirmities, and to forbeare one another in love, <hi>as appeareth in theſe places of Scripture,</hi> Gal. <hi>6.1, 2.</hi> Epheſ. <hi>4.2.</hi> Coloſ. <hi>3.12, 13. and 1</hi> Theſſ. <hi>5.14.</hi> Rom. <hi>14.1.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that this dutie is not onely neceſſary <hi>(neceſſitate praecepti)</hi> becauſe God hath commanded it, but it is alſo neceſſary <hi>(neceſſitate medii)</hi> as a meanes of mutuall edification; which cannot poſſibly bee advanced without the obſervation thereof. <hi>And the reaſon hereof is evident, becauſe in many caſes of humane failings, and in ſome of different opinions and practiſes, if there ſhould bee no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance at all, debates would bee ſharpe and endleſſe, about
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:116741:31"/>every ſmall matter, and for every trifle; the affections of love would bee loſt, the peace of the Churches diſturbed, Schiſmes made unavoidable, and the healing or preventing of breaches become altogether impoſſible,</hi> Rom. <hi>14.13. and 15.1, 2, 3.</hi> Phil. <hi>2.1, 2, 3, 4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And concerning the</hi> bounds and limits of this forbearance, <hi>all will undeniably acknowledge, that it ought not to bee exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded indifferently unto all perſons, opinions and practiſes, but that theſe foure propoſitions are agreeable to the truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, that it is not the mind of Ieſus Chriſt that his ſervants ſhould agree to beare one with another in that which they know to bee evill and contrary to his will, but that their dutie is in ſuch caſes to endeavour the removing of evill, by zeale and brotherly admonitions, <hi>as will appeare in theſe places of Scripture,</hi> Rev. <hi>2.2. and 1</hi> Theſ. <hi>5.14, 15. and 2</hi> Theſ. <hi>3.12, 13, 14, 15. and 1</hi> Cor. <hi>5.2.7.11.13.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that it is not the mind of Chriſt that any of his ſervants ſhould profeſſe themſelves willing, or obliged, to beare with any perſon which doth endeavour, and with any doctrine or practiſe which doth tend to overthrow the faith in his name, which is delivered to the Saints<note n="(a)" place="margin">Iude 3.</note>, or to deſtroy the life and power of godlineſſe either in the private or publick profeſſion of Religion<note n="(b)" place="margin">Tit. 1.10, 11. 2 Tim. 3.5, 6, 7, 8. Gal. 5.7. til 13.</note>, or to diſſolve the bonds of holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion amongſt Chriſtian brethren<note n="(c)" place="margin">Phil. 3.2. Iud. 19. Rom. 16.17, 18.</note>, or to aboliſh the orderly rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and obligations naturall and morall, without which humane ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties cannot ſtand<note n="(d)" place="margin">1 Tim. 5.8. Mat. 15.4, 5, 6. 1 Tim. 4.3.</note>, or to put downe the authoritie which God hath ſet up in and over humane ſocieties for the Adminiſtration of juſtice therein<note n="(e)" place="margin">2 Pet. 2.10. Rom. 13.1. till 8.</note>.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is the mind of Jeſus Chriſt that his ſervants in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters meerly circumſtantiall by him not determined ſhould be left free to follow their owne light, as it may be offered, or ariſe unto them, from the generall rules of edification and not conſtrained by an implicit faith to follow the dictates of other men; and although it may ſometime fall out, that in things of this nature their wayes may be different from the wayes of their brethren; yet that ought not to make any breach of love amongſt them, but they ſhould eſteeme all croſſe and partiall practiſes about them, utterly unlawfull; <hi>becauſe they beget diſputes and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, and tending to diviſions, bring forth hatred and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall perſecutions.</hi> Rom. <hi>14.</hi> per totum, Gal. <hi>5.13, 14, 26.</hi> Phil. <hi>2.3, 4.14, 15.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:116741:32"/>
               <p> Fourthly, that in matters of greater weight, which are not meerely circumſtantiall, but are conceived to bee determined by the word, yet ſo, as that it is differently underſtood: <hi>in this caſe the mind of Chriſt is,</hi> that the rules of Chriſtian charitie and mutuall edification, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably obſerved with all long ſuffering and forbearance. And this courſe ought to be continued ſo long, either as there is hope to gaine the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of loving conferences, whereby differences may be reconciled, and miſtakes and ſcandals prevented and taken out of the way; or ſo long as there is cauſe to thinke that God may reveale his profitable truths to ſuch as erre not wilfully, but through weakeneſſe of judgement and harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, Phil. <hi>3.15, 16. and 2</hi> Tim. <hi>2.22, 23, 24, 25, 26.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Concerning the way how to ſettle and proſecute a mutuall Toleration, by rules wherein there is an agreement.</head>
               <p>HItherto in this matter of forbearance wee have lookt upon the principles of our dutie, which wee conceive both ſides will fully aſſent unto, if now wee can alſo from thence gather, and from other undeniable and knowne truths, find out ſome rules which may direct us in a way, how to ſettle and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute to a full period of practiſe the duties of this forbearance; and if theſe rules being found out can bee applied to the caſe in hand between the parties, by ſome tranſaction ſo fully and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, that none who doth aſſent unto the principles and the rules, can except againſt the proceedings therein; if (I ſay) theſe rules can be thus found out and applied, then we ſhall be able convincingly to conclude that all ſuch as follow not the practiſe thereof, walke neither anſwerable to the light which they have received, nor to the vocation wherewith they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the profeſſion of Chriſtianitie, and conſequently, that as they are not upright in their way, ſo they ſhall bee fruſtrate of the felicitie promiſed thereunto, and receive the reward of hypocrites: for in this caſe that which Chriſt ſaid unto his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, is to bee ſaid unto the miniſtery, and to the profeſſors of this kingdome, <hi>John</hi> 13.17. <hi>If ye know theſe things, happy are yee if yee doe them.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:116741:32"/>
               <p> But if you know them not, you cannot bee happy in doing them; and if knowing them, you doe them not, your profeſſion ſhall be found vaine, and your end eternall miſery; <hi>for not every one that ſaith Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the kingdome of heaven,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 7.21.</note> 
                  <hi>but hee onely who doth the will of God, who is in heaven.</hi> From all which wee muſt gather this concluſion, that if wee know that there is a forbearance, which is neceſſary, it will not be enough for us to know what the principles thereof are, but the way how to practiſe the duties muſt alſo bee ſought after, and regularly followed. Let us then doe this, and endeavour to find the rules of ſuch a tranſaction as will beget between the parties a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that toleration, whereof wee have ſeene and allowed the principles.</p>
               <p>And to this effect if any Treatie or conference be intended (for without ſome ſuch thing nothing can bee ſetled) there muſt be, before all other things, an agreement found <hi>in the aime of the tranſaction,</hi> and in the <hi>meanes</hi> to bring it to paſſe.</p>
               <p>For if theſe two be not determined by common conſent, and a reſolution fixed to proceed according to that determination, nothing will take effect or be ſucceſſefull in the tranſaction.</p>
               <p>The aime then of the tranſaction ſhould not bee to ſettle a forbearance which ſhould leave the parties or confirme them in the diſtance, whereinto they are unhappily fallen: But both ſides ſhould expreſly declare that the Treatie is to bee ſet afoot, and profeſſedly intended for theſe two ends. Firſt, that a <hi>dore may bee kept open and enlarged, to further a more perfect unitie then as yet the parties have attained unto.</hi> Secondly, that a <hi>path and courſe to maintaine the further unitie, which will be attained by Gods bleſſing, may bee prepared and made more plaine and eaſie then hitherto it hath been.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this aime bee ſincerely taken up, the meanes to bring it to paſſe will neither be difficult to be found, nor without ſucceſſe, when they are ſet a worke amongſt true Chriſtians. I ſhall offer therefore at them.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, the meanes to open a dore to advance the parties to a more perfect unitie, then as yet they have attained unto, is to <hi>find out, and ſettle rules of mutuall condeſcenſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the meanes to make the path plaine and eaſie to maintaine and walke in the unitie which ſhall bee ſetled, is, to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:116741:33"/>move by common conſent and upon conſcionable motives all the cauſes of diſaffection and of breaches.</hi> For if both ſides cannot onely yeeld and ſtoop to embrace each other in love, but alſo remove all that which may occaſion the diſſolving of that embracement, we may bee ſure that peace and unitie will bee ſetled without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption. Therefore in hope that either now or hereafter this may bee laid to heart, and followed to produce a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry toleration, I ſhall offer my thoughts of theſe two meanes.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the rules of condeſcenſion, how they may bee found out.</head>
               <p>VVEe have formerly ſeene that ſome toleration amongſt Chriſtians is neceſſary; if ſo, then undoubtedly ſome condeſcenſion alſo towards one another, becauſe without ſome yeelding it is not imaginable that any mutuall forbearance can bee ſetled or tranſacted amongſt parties, that are at variance; and although this might ſuffice to ſatisfie the ſcruples of ſome, who perhaps will boile at the matter of condeſcenſion, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to the truth of the holy profeſſion, yet I ſhall adde a word to ſhew the lawfulneſſe of ſuch a courſe, as being a dutie recommended unto us by God, and neceſſary for edification.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1, 2. ſaith <hi>that we ought not to pleaſe our ſelves, but that every one of us ſhould pleaſe his neighbour for his good to edification.</hi> Now in this caſe every one is ſuppoſed to be ſtrong, and the neighbour, whom hee ought to pleaſe, is by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſuppoſed to be weake. Therefore wee are all bound to yeeld unto each other, as ſuppoſing others to be weake that wee may be able to edifie each other. And to preſſe this home as a dutie to the conſcience of all, hee doth give us Chriſt example, as a patterne thereof in this particular, that he did not ſeek to pleaſe himſelfe, but condeſcended even to beare reproaches, that wee might bee edified by that which is written of him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. and 4. And then to make an application of this unto the end for which he doth preſcribe it as a dutie; hee firſt prayeth to God for us, and ſecondly exhorts us to the imitation of Chriſts example. His prayer is, <hi>that God would grant us to be like minded one towards
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:116741:33"/>another according to Chriſt Jeſus, that wee may glorifie God with one mind and mouth:</hi> where he intimates two things, which are in this matter very conſiderable. Firſt, that except wee have this grace to bee ſo minded unto each others as Chriſt was to us, wee cannot bee at unitie amongſt our ſelves. Secondly, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept wee be united with one mind and one mouth in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt, God cannot be glorified by us, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5 &amp; 6.</p>
               <p>Then his exhortation is a conſequence inferted upon theſe premiſes thus, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Wherefore receive yee one another as Chriſt alſo received us to the glory of God.</hi> Now Chriſt received us to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God (that is, to the participation of Gods love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) by a great condeſcenſion unto our weakneſſe, ſtudying not to pleaſe himſelfe but us to our good; therefore wee are all bound to yeeld unto each other in like manner: ſo then ſome condeſcenſion is both lawfull and requiſite. Compare with this, that which is further to this purpoſe delivered concerning Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6, 7. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, 22, 23.</p>
               <p>But to preſſe further the point which in this dutie is to be hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, let us conſider the precept given by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 16. and his owne practiſe, which hee ſets before us elſewhere to bee followed as an example of that rule.</p>
               <p>The precept is this, <hi>Be of the ſame mind one towards another, mind not high things, but condeſcend to men of low eſtate (or to mean things) bee not wiſe in your own conceits.</hi> As if he had ſaid, it is your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to bee like minded towards each other in love, and that you may not bee taken off from performing this, take heed to your thoughts, that you neither affect high matters, wherein natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally men uſe to pleaſe themſelves, nor that you bee in love with your owne wiſedome, but ſtudie rather to make your mindes pliable, and bring your ſelves to condeſcend to men and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that are meane and low, for except you all reſolve upon this, you can never bee of the ſame mind one towards another: So then wee ſee that ſome condeſcenſion is not onely lawfull, but wholly requiſite to maintaine love and unitie and reſiſt pride and ſelf-love, whence ſtrife and confuſion doth proceed.</p>
               <p>Anſwerable unto this rule was the Apoſtles own practiſe, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. for our imitation, for there from the firſt verſe till the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. he ſheweth that although hee had a full right to take maintenance from the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> for his ſervice
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:116741:34"/>done to them, yet he would not doe it, but condeſcended ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their weakneſſe ſake, to make the Goſpel of Chriſt without charge unto them, leſt hee might bee thought to abuſe his power in the Goſpel. So then to prevent an inconveniencie hee did condeſcend to quit his right to a benefit and a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie, which he might otherwiſe have lawfully enjoyed. But then from <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. till the end of the Chapter, hee ſpeakes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother kind of condeſcenſion wherein hee did exerciſe himſelf, and which hee relates that hee might therein bee imitated by others: which was this, that although hee <hi>was free from all men, yet hee made himſelfe a ſervant to all, that hee might gaine the more. Verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>To the Jewes he became as a Jew, to them that are under the Law as under the Law. Verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>To them that are without Law, as without Law (though hee was not without Law to God, but under the Law to Chriſt). Verſ.</hi> 21. <hi>To the weake he became as weake, and he made himſelfe</hi> (by way of condeſcenſion) <hi>all things unto all men that hee might by all meanes ſave ſome, Verſ.</hi> 22. And the reaſon why hee exerciſed himſelfe in this dutie, was not onely for the good of others, but for his owne good alſo in three things. Firſt, that he might <hi>partake of the Goſpel with every one in every condition, Verſ.</hi> 23. Secondly, that hee might keepe himſelfe in a fit temper of ſpirit, ſo <hi>to run</hi> in his calling, <hi>as to receive the prize, and ſo to fight as not to beate the aire, Verſ.</hi> 24, 25, 26. And thirdly, that hee might <hi>bee maſter of his own body,</hi> leſt if hee neglected the dutie of <hi>bringing it into ſubjection, hee might bee found himſelfe a reprobate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all his paines in preaching the Goſpel unto others, Verſ.</hi> 27. Thus wee ſee that the Apoſtle doth make this not onely a dutie which as lawfull, but in ſome ſort neceſſary to the faithfull diſcharge of the miniſteriall function, even ſo farre that without the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it, a man can neither gaine all ſorts of people to the Goſpel, nor partake fully of the Goſpel himſelfe, nor bee in a temper ſo to runne and ſtrive as to gaine his incorruptible crowne before others, nor at laſt eſcape the danger of being a caſtaway, although hee hath painefully preached the Goſpel unto others. From all which wee muſt conclude, that the ſtudie of condeſcenſion, chiefly in a Miniſter, with whom I am now dealing, is not a matter of indifferencie, but a dutie of very great importance. And if ſo, then wee are obliged in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not onely to reſolve upon the practiſe, but to ſeeke out
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:116741:34"/>the rules by which our converſation in this matter may bee or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered aright: for ſeeing in every dutie, there are ſome rules, and in this of condeſcenſion (becauſe none do ſet themſelves to the practiſe thereof) the rules are not lookt into. Seeing alſo none ought in any thing to preſume to preſcribe rules unto others, but all ſhould rather in all humilitie ſearch after the diſcovery thereof in the holy Scriptures, and then hold forth in ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie that which God doth teach them, and they find profitable for the edification of others, therefore we ſhall apply our ſelves unto this ſearch, and offer that which wee ſuppoſe neither ſide will except againſt; and yet may prove a ſufficient directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the practiſe of condeſcenſion, and the tranſaction of a forbearance in the caſes of our diviſions.</p>
               <p>Wee ſhall ſay then, that to find out without difficultie the rules of condeſcenſion towards a forbearance, three things ſhould bee reflected upon.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 <hi>That wherein there can bee no yeelding.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2 <hi>That wherein there may bee and ought to bee a voluntary yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3 <hi>That which may draw forth, and oblige the ſpirits of men, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the things whereunto they ſhall bee willing of themſelves to yeeld.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concerning the firſt, there can bee no condeſcenſion propoſed which ſhould oblige any to make profeſſion of any thing otherwiſe then it is in his heart.</hi> For no man can with a good conſcience yeeld to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe any untruth, or tranſact to relinquiſh his ſenſe and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of any thing which hee doth eſteeme a point of truth or of right, I ſay no man can condeſcend to relinquiſh his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or his challenge of a right to a priviledge: becauſe the matters of truth and right can edifie no man, but diſedifie both our ſelves and others, if they bee denyed and profeſſedly given up. A man may diſpenſe with a truth ſo farre as not to ſpeak of it, to all ſorts of perſons, or at all times, becauſe they cannot beare it, nor is it ſeaſonable for edification to ſpeake all truths at all times: as wee may ſee by Chriſts example, <hi>John</hi> 16.12. and the Apoſtles practiſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1, 2. and the rules, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.6. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. And concerning a point of right a man may diſpenſe with the uſe of it, as wee ſee the Apoſtle doth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. But no man ought to yeeld himſelfe obliged to deny any truth, or not to beare witneſſe to it when it is oppoſed, or
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:116741:35"/>not to challenge his right to a priviledge, when it is called in queſtion, for to do ſo were to betray truth and righteouſneſſe, which cannot ſtand with a good conſcience: therefore no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion may bee intended to ſuppreſſe the profeſſion of theſe things, but rather a tranſaction is to be intended to this purpoſe, that both ſides ſhall beare with one another in ſuch a profeſſion without offence, and grant a freedome to each other to declare the truth, as it is in their hearts, for this is the dutie and one of the commendable characters of thoſe, <hi>that ſhall abide in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of God and dwell in his holy hill, Pſal.</hi> 15.1, 2.</p>
               <p>Concerning the ſecond, namely <hi>that wherein there may and ought to bee a voluntary yeelding on all ſides;</hi> I ſhall not take upon me to ſpecifie any rules (for that is to bee referred to the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of the forbearance it ſelf) but I ſhall onely mention the heads of matters, whereof rules may bee determined and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the Word.</p>
               <p>As firſt, there may and ought to bee a mutuall condeſcenſion towards the ſetling <hi>of wayes and expedients of different ſorts, of order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceedings at ſeverall places and times in publick meetings, for the confirmation of the unitie of the ſpirits of brethren, in the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and for the avoiding of confuſion.</hi> As for example, at the publick meetings in ſome places they have no Aſſeſſors adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him that is the Prolocutor, in other places they have; in ſome places the Prolocutor or Mediator of the meeting is perpetually the ſame, in other places he is continually chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and that either by a new election through the pluralitie of votes, or without any election by a viciſſitudinary ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one after another, into the office of preſiding over the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: in ſome places nothing is determined without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all, in other places it is otherwiſe: and where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all is required, in ſome places the Preſes of the action is obliged to aske every mans vote diſtinctly and in order; in other places that cuſtome is not preciſely obſerved, but it is free for any one to ſpeak when hee can get a turne, and if matters goe againſt his ſenſe, to enter his diſſent; and elſewhere, who doth not give his conſent, is not obliged to the determination. In all ſuch wayes of orderly proceedings, if thoſe that entertaine the meetings for their mutuall edification do alter their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions according to circumſtances of times, places, perſons, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:116741:35"/>affaires, upon grounds which they think valid for the end for which they meet, (I ſay) in all ſuch wayes a condeſcenſion may and ought to bee mutually intended; and there ought not to bee any breach of unitie and affection for the difference of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions amongſt Brethren in matters of this nature. Onely a care is to bee had, that the generall rules of <hi>order and decency</hi> bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved according to the Apoſtles commandement, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there may and ought to be a voluntary condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>to all the meanes which are thought by thoſe, who are of repute, fit and expedient to give juſt ſatisfaction to any that are poſſeſſed with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt us, or to cleer miſtakes, or to prevent the evill effects of ſiniſter reports, or to take away all inconveniencies and ſcandals of that nature:</hi> (I ſay) there ought to bee a yeelding to all motions in that kind which do not prejudicate the truth: becauſe all things that are commendable and of good report are to bee followed; and all the occaſions of murmurings, of jealouſies and of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents are to bee avoided. In ſuch a caſe as this, <hi>Peter</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to make an Apologie for himſelf to thoſe of the circumciſion who contended with him for his going unto <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius, Act.</hi> 11.2, 3, 4. till 19. and <hi>Paul</hi> at the advice of <hi>James</hi> and the Elders of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> went into the Temple and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to obſerve the cuſtomes of the ceremoniall Law to take away the prejudice which many had againſt him, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. till 28. Another time <hi>Paul</hi> of his owne accord did circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe <hi>Timothy</hi> by way of condeſcenſion to the Jewes, who were weake and would have been offended if that had not been done, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.1, 2, 3. but when the cauſe was altered, and by condeſcending to circumciſe <hi>Titus</hi> the libertie of the Goſpel would have been prejudged towards the Gentiles, he would not at all yeeld unto it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.3.4, 5.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there ought to bee a condeſcenſion in matters of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie, ſuch as the Apoſtle doth mention, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, to beare with the weake: item, in matters of offence, which may bee foreſeen, wee are bound to prevent the ſame by yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto the weake and ignorant, leſt either <hi>our good bee evill ſpoken of, or our Brother be grieved at what wee doe, or his conſcience bee emboldned by our example</hi> (whiles it wanteth light, to diſcerne its owne libertie) <hi>to ſinne, Rom.</hi> 14.15, 16. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9, 10, 11, 12, 13. and <hi>chap.</hi> 10. <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. till the end.</p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:116741:36"/>
               <p> Fourthly and laſtly, there ought to bee a condeſcenſion to <hi>beare with all men in that whereunto they have not yet attained; that by the things whereunto they have attained, and our friendly converſe with them, according to the rules of edification, they may bee gained.</hi> Concerning this way of condeſcenſion towards others, theſe places are conſiderable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.18, 19, 20. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.19. till the end, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.12. and 6.1. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.24, 25, 26, and 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.14, 15.20, 21. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15, 16. And all things which flow from the principles of Charitie, Gentleneſſe, meekneſſe, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, with prudency and diſcretion, for the good of thoſe that erre, and are ignorant, may bee called a condeſcenſion, and ought to bee practiſed in imitation of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, from whom the rules of forbearance are to bee learned, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.13.</p>
               <p>Concerning the third which <hi>is the way to draw forth the ſpirits of men, to diſcover the things whereunto they ſhal be willing of themſelves to condeſcend unto others;</hi> I ſhall offer an expedient which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe none who deſireth to walke in the light will thinke unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable or unconſcionable, and that is this. <hi>That all ſuch as would be borne withall in any thing by others, ſhould offer firſt unto thoſe from whom they expect a brotherly forbearance, all that condeſcenſion which they intend to uſe, and the rules of forbearance by which they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to walke towards them:</hi> for this is according to Chriſts fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall rule of juſtice, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Whatſoever things you would have men doe to you, doe yee even ſo to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.</hi> If this one rule were rightly applyed and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, there would bee no great difficultie in tranſacting this matter; chiefly if wee take up the practiſe of it, not upon the grounds of humane policie, but of Chriſtian obedience to the dutie which is commanded, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Exhort one another daily whiles it is called to day,</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24. <hi>Let us conſider one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to provoke unto love and to good workes,</hi> and <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15, 16. <hi>Bee ye blameleſſe and harmeleſſe, the ſonnes of God, without rebuke, ſhine as lights in the world, bold forth the word of life.</hi> From all which this expedient will follow towards the finding out of the rules of condeſcenſion; that every one who doth delight to goe before others in good workes, and walke in the light, ought (in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the will of God revealed in theſe commandements) of his owne accord to offer unto his neighbour, with whom hee
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:116741:36"/>doth deſire to walke in peace and unitie, a full diſcovery of thoſe principles and rules, by which hee doth find himſelfe obliged in conſcience, according to Gods will, to walke towards every one in the wayes of condeſcenſion.</p>
               <p>If every one would doe this freely and fully, it would bee ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, without any danger of diſagreement or of debates about particular intereſts (which continually trouble the wayes of our profeſſion) to ſet downe the rules of condeſcenſion and forbearance, for that might bee taken as a rule to bind every one, which hee ſhould offer freely, and acknowledge to bee an obligation upon his conſcience; or which being offered unto him by others, ſhould by the Law of love bind him to practiſe the like unto them. For I conceive this to be equall, that what another doth yeeld unto mee (ſuppoſing the matter in it ſelfe to be lawfull) I ſhould yeeld unto him in like manner, even as I would have him yeeld unto mee that which I offer unto him; as then I would not have any to preſſe upon mee any thing of a Religions concernment, further then my light from the Word doth lead mee to embrace it: ſo I ought not to intend to preſſe upon others any thing of that nature fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then their light doth lead them, but as I would bee born withall, ſo I ſhould beare with another, till God give in more light to either of us, by private meditations or regular confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. In the meane time let that which is yeelded on all ſides bee ſetled as a rule of agreement to walke by, and improved to the beſt advantage of peace and unitie. Thus wee ſee, that if every one would but hold forth his principles of light and life unto others, and would bind himſelfe as in the preſence of God, to walke anſwerable thereunto; wee might eaſily come to the ſettlement and obſervation of the rules of condeſcenſion.</p>

               <p>THe firſt and originall cauſes of diſaffection and of breaches are for the moſt part not taken notice of, and hardly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:116741:37"/>by many, even then when they are diſcovered, becauſe they lie very cloſe to our nature, for they are commonly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but the neglect of charitable inclinations and duties; and the unadviſed admitting of prejudices, and entertaining of evill ſurmiſes, which not being obſerved and cured, feſter in the mind, and firſt breed a ſhineſſe or warineſſe of him, againſt whom they are conceived, then a diſtance from him, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a ſtrangeneſſe to his wayes; and laſtly a breach of unitie with oppoſition. The cauſes of prejudice are very many in all ſorts of men; thoſe which the ungodly and naturall man doth entertaine, againſt a conſcionable and religious walking with God, I need not here to meddle withall (<note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>That which doth openly offend, and cauſeth prejudices to riſe in the mindes of men, who are otherwiſe godly, and againſt men who are truely godly and their Brethren, is the <hi>irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of diſputes and debates about matters of Religion,</hi> which is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>twofold,</hi> ſome irregularitie there is, <hi>in reſpect of the matter,</hi> ſome there is, <hi>in reſpect of the manner of diſputing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In reſpect of the matter</hi> prejudices are raiſed, when men ſtrive about <hi>needleſſe matters,</hi> and contend for <hi>words,</hi> and this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth often warne <hi>Timothy</hi> to avoid, as a thing whereunto the Miniſters were and would bee much ſubject, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.4, 5, 6. and <hi>chap.</hi> 4.7. and <hi>chap.</hi> 6.4, 5.20. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16, 17, 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In reſpect of the manner of debating matters which are neceſſary and profitable;</hi> prejudices are raiſed divers wayes, but that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:116741:37"/>which is the moſt common and hurtfull, is that, <hi>of paſſionate and provoking expreſſions againſt a mans perſon and his opinions to make him odious, and his errours thought to bee extreame dangerous in that wherein hee diſſents from us;</hi> theſe railing accuſations, and all other injurious and inſolent proceedings, breed averſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſtirring up mens ſpirits to ſtrife and contradictions, augment prejudices extreamly, and fill the Churches with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance and confuſion.</p>
               <p>That which doth offend more ſecretly and doth beget much prejudice, <hi>is the perverſe and uncharitable obſervation of mens failings, when they are conſtrued ſuſpiciouſly to the worſe ſenſe, and then whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the eares of others,</hi> that are leading men, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a caution, or warning given unto them, to take heed of this or of that, for the ſtrengthning of their hands in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall deſignes, and the promoting of particular intereſts. This darke malicious devill, who covers himſelfe oft-times with a cloke of light and a zeale for holineſſe and truth, is exceeding buſie in our dayes, and hurtfull to our affaires, and doth work his miſchiefe, not onely againſt him, who is blaſted in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, to make all the good which his talents may produce unprofitable unto others; but alſo againſt the Authors of ſuch whiſperings themſelves, to make them the ring-leaders of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and of evill intelligence amongſt brethren.</p>
               <p>Theſe are in brief the chief cauſes of our prejudices, theſe muſt needs bee removed; elſe the way of a lawfull condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and forbearance will never bee plaine and eaſie in the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, nor laſting in the continuance; it will then bee of abſolute neceſſitie that ſome courſe bee taken to remedy the ſame. Therefore I ſhall for the preſent onely adviſe, that when a brotherly tranſaction of matters, towards a mutuall forbearance ſhall bee intended, then ſome rules ſhould bee thought upon, debated, and by common conſent ſetled, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning three things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, how needleſſe diſputes and multiplicitie of new controverſies, breaking forth in the Preſſe and Pulpit may be prevented.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, how the injuriouſneſſe of cenſures and of proceeding, which men of partiall diſpoſitions and of high thoughts runne into, may bee rectified; when diſputes are neceſſary: And</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, how the ſecret miſchief of ſuſpicious whiſperings and tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:116741:38"/>amongſt Brethren may bee prevented, and being diſcovered ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfactorily corrected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that ſome rules of righteouſneſſe may bee found in the Word to remedie theſe evills, and may bee raiſed from the nature of Chriſtian charitie, equitie, ingenuitie, pietie, diſcretion, and prudencie: I ſuppoſe none will deny, who doth beleeve that the holy Scriptures with and by the ſpirit of God, which is promiſed to the children of God are able to make the man of God perfect, and throughly furniſhed unto every good word and worke.</p>
               <p>Thus I have made out (as briefly and as diſtinctly as this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſeemeth to require) the truth of the firſt and ſecond aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this diſcourſe, namely that the Miniſtery of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is undeniably obliged in conſcience to the mutuall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Brotherhood; and that the termes of their unitie and forbearance, are both in themſelves full and ſatisfactory, and may bee ſetled reciprocally amongſt them, in a plaine and eaſie way, if the men that lead others, were but willing to looke to God more then to men, and to conſcience more then to outward intereſts.</p>

               <p>BUt now although theſe things are evidently thus demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable, and by all that which hitherto hath been alledged; it may be manifeſtly apparent, that theſe who are the leaders of the flockes, ſhould not onely ſtand united, and walk by one rule in that whereunto they have attained; but alſo, that their differences may and ought to bee compoſed in love by amiable meetings, by orderly conferences, and by the ſettlement of a neceſſary and lawfull forbearance of each other: although (I ſay) all this is ſo, yet wee ſee to the great diſhonour of God, the lamentable diſadvantage of the truth, and the extreame griefe of many godly ſoules, that this hath not hitherto, either
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:116741:38"/>beene done or effectually proſecuted and intended by thoſe that are in the worke of the Miniſtery, or if it hath been intended by ſome, yet not ſo as it ought to have been, that is, upon the grounds which are proper unto their vocation.</p>
               <p>What the cauſes of this neglect may bee, wee ſhall not now particularly ſearch into; onely in generall, wee may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that all ſuch failings in dutie may proceed from two main cauſes; either that men (otherwiſe knowing and godly, yet) <hi>conſider not the neceſſitie of this dutie in reſpect of the evills that follow upon the neglect thereof, or that the excellencie, commendableneſſe and worth thereof is either not known, or if not unknown, yet not laid to heart.</hi> Now then in this our preſent ſad condition if any thing can be ſuggeſted which may be a helpe to remove theſe cauſes of our failing in this kind, it may bee hoped, that godly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable men will bee more carefull of the performance, and more fearefull of the neglect thereof, then hitherto they have been. Therefore it will not bee amiſſe but may bee of very great uſe, to offer ſome motives and inducements to incline them without partialitie to theſe reſolutions, and this wee ſhall intend to doe if God permit.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Concerning the neceſſitie of Brotherly unitie in the Miniſtery.</head>
               <p>IF then we ſhould take into conſideration the abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this dutie, it will appeare that the preſent evills where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into theſe Churches, and the ſtate of this kingdome are fallen, and which threaten all with unavoydable ruine, are mainely brought upon us through the neglect of that miniſteriall unitie and correſpondencie, which is ſutable unto Chriſtianitie.</p>
               <p>For whoſoever in the feare of God ſhall lay to heart the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full condition of the Churches of Chriſt in this land, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that amongſt the manifold cauſes of our miſerable breaches and ſinfull diſtractions,<note place="margin">The cauſe of all one miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> the originall and conſequently the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of all the reſt is this; That ſuch as are called to bee the Miniſters of the Goſpel, who by their owne confeſſion are Brethren and fellow-labourers in the ſame imployment, doe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:116741:39"/>not maintaine thoſe duties of Brotherly love, fellowſhip and communion, which by the nature of their work, and by the appointment of their Lord and Maſter are made neceſſary for the manifeſtation of his glory, and for their own mutuall edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. For ſeeing by that which hath been hitherto ſhewed, it muſt needs be acknowledged, that they ought to ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and looke upon each other as Brethren begotten of the ſame Father, as fellow-ſouldiers in the ſame fight and warfare, and as fellow-members in the ſame body of Chriſt: Seeing (I ſay) this is confeſſed and cannot bee denied to bee ſo, it will follow alſo undeniably, that they ought in conſcience to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the duties belonging to theſe relations, which are not onely to profeſſe a Brotherhood, but to bee knit together in fervent love, to have the ſame care one for another, and joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to communicate in things belonging to the kingdome of Chriſt. But that theſe duties, notwithſtanding all theſe relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are neither really thought upon, nor at all proſecured to any purpoſe almoſt by any, is no leſſe undeniable, and muſt needs (although to our great ſhame) be plainly and ingenuouſly confeſſed. Seeing then the guilt of this their fault is ſo great and ſo apparent, that no colour of excuſe can bee pretended to extenuate it, therefore the judgement is ripe for them, and the puniſhment hath now in the ſight of all the world moſt juſtly overtaken them: For whereas they were lately in a capacitie to bee as happy within themſelves, and as profitable to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt abroad, as any of all the Miniſters on earth if they had continued in their unitie, now they are like to bee more unſetled and more miſerable within themſelves, and leſſe reſpected by others, and leſſe uſefull both at home and abroad towards the cauſe of Chriſt, then any that are elſewhere in all the Churches, &amp; this onely, becauſe they have ſuffered themſelves in their profeſſion to bee divided, and have not regarded nor doe they yet regard the duties of their Chriſtian Brotherhood ſo much as outward concernments.<note place="margin">The guilt of the Miniſtery.</note> For by this meanes they <hi>have corrupted the Covenant,</hi> and are become partiall in the Law, and cauſed <hi>many to ſtumble</hi> at the Law,<note place="margin">Mal. 2.8, 9.</note> and therefore the <hi>Lord hath made them contemptible,</hi> and cauſed all their adverſaries to prevaile againſt them, ſo that they have juſt cauſe to give glory unto him, to lay their hands upon their mouths, to be ſenſible
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:116741:39"/>of their guiltineſſe, and to accept of the puniſhment of their tranſgreſſions.<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.1, 2, 3.</note> For if the very vocation wherewith all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Goſpel are called unto God, doth oblige them to <hi>keepe the unitie of the ſpirit in the bond of peace one with another;</hi> farre more doth it oblige the Miniſters, to intend before others this great and fundamentall dutie in the vocation wherewith they are called. And if all the members of the myſticall body of Chriſt are by Gods appointment fitly joyned together, and ought to bee compacted in their ſtations to make the increaſe of the body unto the edifying of it ſelfe in love, by that which every joynt ſupplieth, then it muſt needs alſo be granted, that the chief joynts of theſe members are more eſpecially appointed by God, and obliged in conſcience to bee united in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and compacted in the duties of their miniſteriall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. But how farre they are not onely diſtant from this conjunction, but have even an averſion unto it, I need not at all to mention (the thing is cleere as the Sunne at noone day) nor ſhall I ſearch at whoſe dore the fault doth principally lie, whether here or there (for I know that every one will juſtifie his owne proceedings). But this I ſhall freely ſay, and I ſay it with grief of heart; and therefore I hope without offence to either ſide; that this is the great ſinne of the Miniſtery, and the miſery of this Nation, that at this time, when a concurrence of affections and of endeavours, is ſo abſolutely neceſſary for the preſervation of the truth in the very fundamentals thereof,<note place="margin">The ſinfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery following upon this guilt.</note> and when we all are called forth to fight in the ſame cauſe as it were for our life, that (I ſay) at this time there is ſo much of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſitie prevailing, and ſo ſmall a ſenſe of Chriſtianitie in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon duties and of imminent dangers found in mens hearts, that it is almoſt impoſſible to move any to compaſſionate one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers calamities; farre leſſe to draw any to riſe up and ſtand united, for each others conſervation, that (I ſay againe) it is ſo with us at ſuch a time, this is the great ſinne of the Miniſtery and the miſery of this Nation. For where is the man to bee found that doth truely mourne, and not rejoyce rather at his oppoſites parties failings and miſcarriages; and yet wee know that <hi>charitie doth not rejoyce at iniquitie?</hi> where is hee that doth ſeeke to heale breaches upon common principles and without a particular intereſt?<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.6. 1 Cor. 13.5.</note> and yet wee all know that <hi>charitie doth

               </p>
               <p>What ſhall wee ſay then to theſe things? ſhall wee ſtill juſtifie our ſelves notwithſtanding the manifeſt tranſgreſſion of all theſe rules? No ſurely, for to cover or to excuſe this fault would ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate the guilt thereof; and to diſcover or condemne it, is the way to gaine pardon for it; but to reforme and remove the cauſes thereof, is that onely which in this caſe will make us happy: for it will availe nothing to confeſſe our ſinne, except it bee forſaken. Let us then looke upon it ſo, as to reſolve ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually upon a courſe of reformation. Our ſinne, in a word, is this breach of Chriſtian unitie. The chief cauſes thereof are carnall ſelf-ſeeking, diſorderly controverſies, and the want of true brotherly inclinations, notwithſtanding the manifold bonds, and the name of brotherhood taken up amongſt us. The remedies of theſe cauſes are, that wee ſhould learne ſelf-deniall from Chriſt, <hi>that wee ſhould not ſtrive nor cry, nor let our voice bee heard in the ſtreets,</hi>

Upon all in generall.</note> For whilſt wee are thus at a diſtance for points of outward order, the inward ſubſtance of the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not regarded. Whilſt wee contend for circumſtantials, concerning the wayes of going about our worke, the maine of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:116741:40"/>the worke is left undone; and whilſt for temporall jealouſies about ſmall matters, Brethren uphold no ſpirituall correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, Satan in matters of the greateſt concernments hath gotten this advantage againſt us, that the whole doctrine of truth is become doubtfull unto very many; and the Goſpel it ſelf, and in it the wayes of peace (the chief object of comfort) are made a matter of ſtrife and contradiction unto all. And if wee will obſerve particulars, wee ſhall perceive that amongſt other things by this way of ſtrife and contradiction, hee hath prevailed chiefly in this, that the very being of an orderly Miniſtery is called in queſtion, and oppoſed moſt univerſally: For to aboliſh the work, and the office of the ordinary miniſtery, is that about which under ſeverall pretences all his agents on all hands, are moſt earneſtly imployed, and by their meanes all the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of order and ordinances in the Church are already unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and all the grounds of authoritie in the State are almoſt quite overthrown: For by and upon ſome principles of that, which is called a new light, it is free for every one to doe what ſeemeth good in his owne eyes without controule, or giving account thereof unto any. This licentious freedome doth leade them that follow it to the fulfilling of all their fleſhly deſires, and doth confirme them in all manner of confuſion, wherein the ſpirit of railing, of bitterneſſe, of envy, of contradiction and of uncharitableneſſe in oppoſing and cenſuring others, doth increaſe ſtrife and hatred, and multiplieth ſcandals infinitely, all which bring forth the woes that lie upon us. For to raile and calumniate without ſhame is become the very trade of many; nor is there any way left almoſt either in Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to redreſſe the injuries of this kind, though never ſo groſſe and palpable. All this breaketh the hearts of the godly, ſtaggereth the weake, gladdeth the adverſaries, openeth a dore to all profaneneſſe, and cauſeth the Name of God to bee blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, and the way of truth to bee evill ſpoken of in the world, at which Atheiſts and Papiſts triumph and exult with joy, expecting in the end, that the effect of all this will bee the utter ruine and deſolation of all Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>Hee that cannot ſee theſe evills to riſe originally from the misbehaviours of Brethren in the Miniſtery of the Goſpel about their differences, is wholly blind; hee that doth not feele the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:116741:41"/>thereof is ſenſeleſſe, and hee that cannot grieve for the ſame, is hardned in ſinfulned.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe all theſe inconveniencies reach unto all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors in ſome ſort alike, therefore every one (though chiefly the Miniſters, as chief of the Profeſſors) ſhould bee moved thereby to contribute their whole ſtrength towards the ſpeedy removall thereof.</p>
               <p>But beſides theſe common evils, there is in this neglect (whereof the Miniſtery is moſt of all guiltie) ſomething which doth more eſpecially reflect, (and that juſtly) upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, more then others,<note place="margin">More eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon the Miniſtery.</note> and from them upon their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall function, as tending to make void the authoritie, and wholly fruſtrate the end of their ordinary vocation. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though perſonal faults ought not to prejudice the vocation &amp; the credit of the function; yet becauſe it is very naturall to all men to make a conſequence from the one to the other, therefore the Apoſtle will have even the meaneſt of the profeſſion to behave themſelves ſo, as it may not ſuffer any diſeſteeme for their ſakes. For ſpeaking of ſervants profeſſing Chriſtianitie to <hi>Titus</hi> and to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tit. 2.10.</note> he will have them to ſhew all good fidelitie unto their maſters, <hi>that they may adorne the dectrine of Chriſt our Saviour in all things,</hi>

If then Chriſtianitie it ſelf will ſuffer in the opinions of men, and bee diſcredited by the faults of the meaneſt that take the name thereof upon them, how ſhall it not bee diſcredited by the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages of thoſe that are the chiefeſt of the profeſſion? and how ſhall the credit of the miniſtery be upheld in mens opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and affections, if thoſe to whom the charge thereof is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, diſhonour their adminiſtration? and how can they bee thought to honour their adminiſtration, if they walke not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable unto the end thereof?

For how can they reforme others, that are not reformed themſelves? How can they bee thought fit to perfect the Saints ſo long as they ſeek not one anothers perfection? how can they be ſaid to advance the unitie of Faith who doe all things belonging to the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith within themſelves dividedly? How can they in the work of the Miniſtery be able joyntly to build up the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, who in that work maintain no communion one with another in reference unto his body; but rather ſet themſelves to make up every one a ſeparate body for himſelfe? and how can they be able to bring all unto the unitie of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man through love, whoſe imperfection in love is ſuch; that they doe value no common relations unto Chriſt and his ſervice further then theſe ſet up ſome private inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts; nor do mind the unitie of the ſpirit through the love of Chriſt which is common unto all, ſo much as to entertain either commemberſhip, or miniſteriall fellowſhip, or true Goſpel-work-acquaintance with any, that are not either ſetled in the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall courſes of their way, or willing to come up unto them therein? Wee ſee then upon theſe grounds, that except this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of dutie be reformed, and the true end of the Miniſteriall work without humane aimes, be heartily entertained by thoſe to whom it is intruſted, the effects thereof will never proſper in their hands; but Satan (as hitherto he hath done ſince they were divided) will continually prevaile againſt them all, till hee hath brought them unto finall deſtruction and irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſolation.</p>
               <p>This then is the danger whereinto wee are fallen, and to lay this to heart is that matter of abſolute neceſſitie, which by all ſhould be apprehended, but chiefly by thoſe that are called to the Miniſtery, that they in doing their principall dutie, which is to ſtudie unitie in the truth in Chriſtianity, may uphold the holy profeſſion, and thereby intend their mutuall preſervation. For without all doubt their very being in this kingdome, if they take not this courſe, will be very ſhortly in a moſt deſperat condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; becauſe as it is undeniably apparent, that hitherto nothing but their own diſunion about matters extrafundamentall, hath
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:116741:42"/>made Satan and their enemies to prevaile againſt them.<note place="margin">The applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to exhort to unitie.</note> So it is cleerly manifeſt that henceforth nothing but their mutuall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will bee effectuall to maintain what they yet hold, or reſtore what they have loſt in the minds of men, and of their ſtanding in the profeſſion; hee then that doth decline to concurre in the wayes of ſpirituall unitie with thoſe that offer and ſue for the ſame unto him, and being convicted of this danger doth not endeavour to prevent it, ſhall bee found guilty of all the evils that follow upon our breaches, of all the ruine that befalleth unto theſe Churches, of all the confuſions that from thence ariſe unto the Commonwealth, of all the diſhonor done to the name of Chriſt for want of order in his houſe, and of all the ſhame and reproach which this Nation is either now aſperſed withall abroad amongſt their Neighbours, or will in after ages cleave unto it. If then there is any love to the Fundamentall truths of the Goſpel, if there is any zeale for righteouſneſſe and againſt damnable hereſies, if there is any juſt hatred due to Blaſphemies, and to the wayes of profaneneſſe and licenciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whereby the kingdome of Satan is erected, and ſetled upon the ruines of Chriſts kingdome amongſt us; and if there is any faithfulneſſe and conſtancie to bee expected from thoſe that profeſſing Chriſtianitie, have entred into ſolemne prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations, vowes and covenants to ſtand united according to the will of God, for the advancement of a common reformation, and the ſettlement of our union therein: if I ſay there bee any ſuch thing as love to truth, zeale for righteouſneſſe and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of Chriſtian Covenants; I may adjure ſuch as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thereunto, to ſhew themſelves at this time therein, for their owne and their Brethrens preſervation, that by the duties of Brotherly unitie in the holy profeſſion, they may bee found to keepe faith and a good conſcience without blame.</p>
               <p>For as it is not poſſible, that the Faith once given to the Saints can bee maintained by any, without a good conſcience, ſo the integritie of a good conſcience cannot bee kept without obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the end of the holy Commandement, which is the practiſe of love out of a pure heart. Now this practiſe amongſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in their Miniſteriall charges, can bee none other but a conſcionable concurrence of their ſpirits in that aime, wherein the all relate unto Chriſt, to ſtrengthen one anothers hands
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:116741:42"/>in the works of his ſervice. For their unity and love to each other can have no truth, but as it relates unto him, nor can it relate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe unto him, then by fulfilling his will, in doing the works of his ſervice; and if this aime be loſt in any, let them pretend what they will, their conſcience is not ſound, their performance is not acceptable, nor will their indeavours be for ever eſtabliſhed; hence it is, that becauſe many have left off to aime ſincerely at this (who either delight to ſtand wholly by themſelves, and give way to dividing principles and practiſes; or thinke it more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to ſtand wholly aſſociated, but give way to the meanes of humane power to truſt more thereunto then to the duties of Chriſtian love and ſerviceableneſſe) therefore it is juſt with God to withdraw from ſuch of both ſides that walke in theſe wayes, and from their undertakings, the bleſſing of his preſence. So that by reaſon of the want of his ſtrength to goe along, and conduct, to guide them, all their hands are weakned, nothing which is undertaken doth proſper, the ſervice of Chriſts houſe is not advanced, the ſtewards thereof are either divided by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or ſcattered by others, and generally they are as men without a heart, afraid one of another: and through theſe their breaches, a whole deluge of damnable errors, and a full cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of all unrighteous, wicked and ſcandalous practiſes, hath overwhelmed and almoſt drowned the Churches; ſo that the very floodgates of hell ſeeme to bee opened upon us, and have covered us with the proud waves of all licenciouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>And although it cannot bee denied, but that it is juſt with God, to ſuffer Satan thus farre to prevaile againſt all for the ſinnes of all, and to make this breach upon the Leaders for their failing in the Miniſtery; yet it is farre from mee to thinke,<note place="margin">A doubt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the office of the Miniſtery.</note> (as ſome doe) that the promiſe of God is failed in this our age; at if there were neither true Church nor Miniſtery any more amongſt us, or any where in this world, but that the gates of hell, having prevailed againſt the Church, which Chriſt did once inſtitute by his Apoſtles; a new miſſion muſt be expected, and a new foundation laid for the erecting of his kingdome. I ſay God forbid that I ſhould thinke ſo. Yea, let God bee true but every man a liar: for <hi>I beleeve that heaven and earth ſhall paſſe away,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3.4. Matth. 24.35. Matth. 16.16, 17, 18, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>but the word that is gone out of Chriſts mouth ſhall not paſſe away.</hi> Now Chriſt upon a ſpeciall occaſion ſaid diſtinctly unto
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:116741:43"/>his Diſciples three things, which are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>That his Church ſhould bee built upon the rock of that truth,</hi> whereof the Apoſtles made confeſſion, which was, <hi>that Jeſus was the Chriſt, the ſonne of the living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>That the gates of hell ſhould not prevaile againſt that Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 And laſtly, <hi>That the keyes of the kingdome of heaven with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to bind and looſe on earth, whatever ſhould be bound and looſened in heaven, ſhall be given to this Church.</hi> Theſe promiſes I beleeve to bee ſo ſure that they ſhall never faile: Therefore I muſt conclude, that neither the foundation of the Church, nor the Church which is builded thereupon, nor the Miniſteriall authoritie of the keyes given to that Church, ſhall faile ſo long as this world doth laſt. For what although ſome doe not beleeve, and are diſobedient to the will of God; ſhall their unbelief and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience make the faith and truth of God without effect? God forbid, yea all men are to bee found liars, that God may bee found true; for he hath concluded all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all: therefore in his ſayings he ſhall be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and when he is judged overcome. Wee muſt therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that by our unrighteouſneſſe the righteouſneſſe of God is to be commended; and that although we of this Nation ſhould utterly faile him, and bee no more worthy to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Church, yet that he will never faile to doe what hee hath ſaid unto the ſeed of Chriſt amongſt men, and never recall the word which hee hath ſpoken concerning his Church. But this we are bound to beleeve,<note place="margin">Iſa. 59.21.</note> that whereſoever there is a ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic of men beleeving with their heart, and with their mouth making openly profeſſion of this truth, that Jeſus is the Chriſt the Sonne of the living God, there is a Church exiſtent; and whereſoever a Church is exiſtent, there the authoritie of the keyes is not wanting; becauſe Chriſt hath ſaid that the gates of hell ſhall not prevaile againſt it. I ſhall then confidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from theſe premiſes two things, firſt, ſeeing there are ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of beleevers which are here exiſtent and known to bee built upon that truth, which is the foundation, that therefore notwithſtanding all theſe failings in particular duties, whereof they are guiltie, that yet Gods promiſe for the main will never be wanting to them, as to his Church. Secondly, I may infer this alſo, that notwithſtanding all the advantages which Satan
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:116741:43"/>ſeemeth to have gotten, both againſt the Miniſtery of this Church, and againſt their adminiſtrations therein (whereby hee doth blaſt them, and the fruit of their labours) yet wee may bee ſure, that he ſhall never prevaile ſo farre as to make void the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the Church, which is to have a right to the keyes of the kingdome of heaven, and thereby to the adminiſtration of all Chriſts Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Now then although indeed it is very ſad and lamentable, that the Builders themſelves ſhould be ſo far wanting to their dutie, as by their diviſions to give ſuch an advantage unto Satan, that hee ſhould bee able, viſibly to pull down more then they are able to build up: yet we know that all things, even theſe ſame and ſuch like failings,<note place="margin">The comfort of beleevers againſt theſe evils. Pſal. 76.10.</note> will worke together for the beſt towards thoſe that love God, and that all the advantages which Satan hath gotten againſt the kingdome of Chriſt, will tend together to Gods greater glory and Satans owne overthrow at laſt. For as <hi>the wrath of man ſhall ſurely praiſe the Lord,</hi> ſo the plots of Satan and all his prevailing upon the infirmities of his Saints, when he ſhall have mercy upon <hi>Zion,</hi> will redound exceedingly to the increaſe of his glory, by the manifeſtation of the riches of his grace, and of the ſtabilitie of his purpoſes, in ſetting up the kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt through a finall and totall deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all the enemies thereof. Seeing then I have cauſe to hope for ſuch an iſſue of this warfare, I ſhall not feare that the diſcovery of this failing in the Miniſtery will bee taken as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to diſcredit them towards others in their function (which I acknowledge in its own way and degree to be of God &amp; not of man) but rather as an admonition of love to ſhow to thoſe that are conſcionable the neceſſity of laying their owne condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to heart, and of ſeeking the remedy thereof, in that way wherein it may bee found. And that I may not bee wanting unto this deſigne, I ſhall adde one thing more,<note place="margin">The neceſſitie of unitie fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſſed.</note> for the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the neceſſitie of this dutie of brotherly unitie, which is ſo much neglected amongſt us, that afterwards I may come to ſpeake more fully of the uſefulneſſe and excellency thereof.</p>
               <p>In the profeſſion of Chriſtianitie the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumciſion availeth any thing nor uncircumciſion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6.15, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>but a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And as many as walke by this rule, Peace (ſaith bee will) bee upon them and mercy, and upon the Iſrael of God.</hi> Here then wee
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:116741:44"/>ſee that the fruits of Peace and of mercy are Gods bleſſings upon the life of the new Creature; and where theſe fruits are not at all apparent, but on the contrary a ſpirit of ſtrife, of bitterneſſe, of hatred and of mercileſſe affection doth prevaile, there wee needs muſt ſay, that the old creature is ſtill alive, <hi>becauſe the wiſedome which is earthly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 3.14, 15, 16, 17, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>ſenſuall and devilliſh,</hi> which is the old mans rule, brings forth ſuch effects. Now it is the proper worke of the true Miniſters of the Goſpel, to perſwade all men to live the life of the new Creature, and to <hi>mortifie the members of the old man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 3.5.8.</note> 
                  <hi>which are upon the earth,</hi> whereof theſe are a part. But if through the ſpirit of diviſion and variance, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters themſelves are intangled in theſe paſſions, and that even one againſt another; ſo that they doe not ſhew forth all meekneſſe with all long-ſuffering and forbearance, wherein they ought to receive each other to the glory of God, as Chriſt received us, how can they performe this worke? how can they perſwade others to walke by a rule which they mind not, and wherein they themſelves are not exerciſed? It is cleer then, that to doe the proper worke of their Miniſtery, it is neceſſary for them to intend the dutie of brotherly love and unitie.</p>
               <p>Moreover it is ſaid here, that neither circumciſion nor uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion doth availe any thing in Chriſt Jeſus, and if this is ſo, then the diviſion and diſtraction, which is amongſt us for things of ſuch a kind is ſinfull and neceſſary to bee left off; for I am ſure that circumciſion to the Jewes, and uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion to the Gentile was a matter of greater concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then any thing about which wee at this time are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. And if that ought not to have made a breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, farre leſſe theſe things amongſt us. Now that which by the new Creature <hi>is available in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5.6.</note> 
                  <hi>is faith onely which worketh by love.</hi> If then the Miniſters of the Goſpel are appointed by God to beget faith and love in their hearers (that is, to perſwade the unbeleevers thereunto, and to build up and confirme and increaſe the beleevers therein) by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Jeſus, and by their unitie and love amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, how ſhall they bee able to doe this, except they bee firſt agreed to hold forth the ſame teſtimony, and except there be ſome amiable concurrence amongſt them in the workes of their Miniſtery? Therefore as faith and love are inſeparably neceſſary
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:116741:44"/>to make a true Chriſtian: ſo the teſtimony of Jeſus, and the ſpirit of unitie are inſeparably requiſite for the worke of the Miniſtery. For as there is an abſolute neceſſitie lying upon the Miniſtery to beare witneſſe unto the truth, towards the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation thereof, for the ſaving of their own ſoules: So they are alſo no leſſe neceſſitated to maintain the profeſſion of their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, for the edification of their hearers. For without this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that manifeſtation will never in reaſon be found a truth fit to convict the world, which otherwiſe it may be; becauſe as it is juſt, that when witneſſes doe not agree, their teſtimony ſhould not be received, ſo it is equitable that when they doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, their teſtimony ſhould not be rejected. And if by this one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly default, they make their teſtimony without effect, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that to eſtabliſh the truth and not to diſcredit it, to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Miniſtery and not to make it contemptible, to build up the Churches and not to ruine them, and to confirme the faith of the Profeſſors and not to ſtagger them, the profeſſion and practiſe of Brotherly unitie amongſt the Miniſters of the Goſpel, is abſolutely neceſſary. For all may ſee, that are not blind and ſenſeleſſe; that originally nothing but the neglect of this dutie, hath deprived us of all our hopes and bleſſings, and brought us under the yoake of all theſe miſeries. Upon all which this conſequence doth manifeſtly follow; that the onely way to preſerve the remnant which is left entire, to reſtore that which is not utterly decaied in the Church, and to helpe this diſtracted State unto ſome ſettlement (if there be any poſſibility of attaining it) is this. That the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould ſet themſelves to concurre and correſpond toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they may hold forth unto the world in the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt, the lovelineſſe, the peaceableneſſe, the meekneſſe and the unitie of his ſpirit, to the end that both they and their hearers may follow therein his footſteps, as hee is gone before us to leave us an example. For this is a path of the new and the living way, which hee hath conſecrated for us; and out of this way no man can come unto the Father, it is therefore abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, that ſuch as will enter into the holieſt, become followers of God as deare children, and walke in love as Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and made himſelfe as one of us, even our Brother, to gaine us unto God.</p>

                  <p>HItherto wee have reflected upon that which doth make the ſtudie of brotherly love and unitie amongſt us abſolutely neceſſary to avoid the danger of ruine and deſtruction, and the guilt of hindering the progreſſe of the Goſpel in the world; now wee ſhall reflect alſo upon the uſefulneſſe and commendableneſſe of the dutie in reference unto the work of the Miniſtery. It is no generous diſpoſition to be drawn by meer neceſſitie and feare unto a dutie, but to bee moved thereunto by the lovelineſſe of grace, and by that which is excellent therein, is praiſeworthy and argueth a noble and vertuous inclination. Therefore wee ſhall ſet our ſelves to worke upon this inclination, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to waken it in every one that hath ingenuitie. And my aime ſhall bee rather to deale with the underſtandings of all (able to conſider of their wayes) to demonſtrate that which I conceive to bee a dutie; then with the affections of any, to perſwade them unto a performance, before they are convicted of that, which is the will of God therein. For I ſhall ſpeak to Miniſters, and ſuch as I muſt ſuppoſe to bee conſcionable; and to thoſe I knew nothing ſo effectuall to perſwade, as to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence unto them, that a matter is conformable unto the will of God, for nothing but this doth intereſt conſcience into action.</p>

For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall rule is cleer, <hi>that wee are indeed called unto libertie, onely wee muſt neither uſe</hi> libertie, nor plead for it,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.13, 14.</note>

For it is not the Theoreticall upholding of a truth that will ſave us, but the doing of the will of God: woe be then unto us, if by our diſputes for that which wee think to bee truth and righteouſneſſe, Satan doth inſnare us; and by the practiſe of a ſingular diſtance, doth ſo far lead us out of the way, as to make us his inſtruments to divide and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynt the ſpirits and the practiſes of profeſſors; that the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall unitie of the whole, and the viſible conjunction of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, being put out of the thoughts and aimes of common profeſſors, all ſocieties may bee broken to pieces, and all rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:116741:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>to common duties made void, according to the will and fanſie of every one, that will pretend to bee a Saint in ſuch or ſuch a degree above his neighbour; that ſo by our ſingular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances through ſtrife (for ſelfe-intereſts) ſcandals may bee mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, and the honour of Gods Name in the holy profeſſion blaſphemed in the world. Therefore to avoid all this, nothing is ſo fit or more neceſſary and uſefull, then to maintaine this communion and correſpondency, which we plead for, which is nothing elſe but a free and voluntary concurrence of ſpirituall counſels and endeavours, which God as the Father of Spirits and King of Saints doth require in his children and Office-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, for the advancement of the kingdome of his Son, that it may appear unto the world, that the Church is his houſe, that hee is the ruler of it by his Word and Spirit, and that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters thereof depend unanimouſly upon him, as his children and ſervants; and that in their mutuall relations they ſtand uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to each other, not by a rule of their owne chuſing and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting; from which they may exclude one way or other whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they pleaſe, but by the common rule which is his love, whereby they are bound to each other as Brethren, and as his ſervants, that is, fellow-members of the ſame body of Chriſt; for al the members of every body, are but ſervants to the head in the whole &amp; to to each other for the heads ſake, and for the good of the whole. Although then every member hath a facultie of life, and a right through that facultie to act in and by it ſelf, the worke of its owne office; and hath immediatly from the head its direction what to doe; and is not under the command of any particular fellow-member yet in the uſe of this facultie, and in the exerciſe of this right, every member is directed by the head to ſubordinate it ſelfe to the ſervice of the whole, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the unitie thereof, and not to ſtand or act by it ſelf: for the Apoſtle ſaith, that the eye cannot ſay to the hand I have no need of thee; nor the head (though head, and over all the reſt) to the feet (though but feet, and under all the reſt) I have no need of you, but even the weakeſt and the moſt unſeemly members are the moſt neceſſary, and every one of them in the performance of their duties towards the whole (for none of them are allowed to doe any thing for themſelves alone) are made to depend upon each other. If this doctrine were laid to heart, and applied practically (without diſputing) to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:116741:47"/>matters now in diſpute, and if our braines were leſſe, and our conſciences more exerciſed in looking herein to that which is (without all diſpute) the known will of God, wee ſhould not need to be troubled with the nicities (though wee might conferre about them) of the proper ſeat of right to power and government, and with the nationall debates of the prioritie of the univerſall, and of the rights and priviledges of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, upon which rocks our affections being now ſplit, all the duties of neceſſary communion, correſpondency, and concurrence are neglected amongſt us, notwithſtanding all the known excellencie, commendableneſſe and uſefulnes thereof. Therefore my purpoſe is to ſet before the conſciences of thoſe that ſeek life, the lovelineſſe of this dutie whereunto we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready attained; if ſo be we will but put forth our hand unto it, as to the tree of life in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God, and not feed upon the Theory of diſputable opinions concerning par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular rights and priviledges; which are to us a tree of the knowledge of good and evill, whereof the fruit doth worke nothing but death and enmitie between God and us: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man nothing but ſtrife and diſtances, by reaſon of our pride wherewith our knowledge doth puffe us up, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare ſomewhat more then others in all our undertakings.</p>

                  <p>THe holy Ghoſt hath ſet himſelf of purpoſe to commend Unitie and Charitie unto us, (which now I am to ſpeak of) in two ſeverall places of Scripture, which I ſhall make the matter of this Section, to repreſent onely the heads thereof in brief unto ſuch as are conſcionable, that by themſelves they may lay the thing to heart and weigh it conſideratly, that God may perſwade their affections to the practiſe thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> The excellencies of brotherly unitie are ſet forth in the 133. <hi>Pſal.</hi> where firſt by way of preface and propoſition the holy Ghoſt doth call upon us, and invites us to contemplate and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſame with admiration in the twofold propertie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>viz.</hi> the goodneſſe and the pleaſantneſſe which is in it. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:116741:48"/>how good and how pleaſant it is, for Brethren to dwell together in unitie, Verſ.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>Then ſecondly, by way of proof and demonſtration he doth ſhew wherein that goodneſſe and pleaſantneſſe doth conſiſt, and whence it doth proceed. The goodneſſe and pleaſantneſſe of brotherly unitie doth conſiſt in this, that it doth bring with it to thoſe that maintain it, all manner of bleſſings in great plentie. The bleſſings are both ſpirituall and bodily, the firſt in the Church, the ſecond in the Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>The ſpirituall bleſſings beſtowed in the Church, are the graces of the holy anointing, <hi>it is like the oyntment,</hi> whoſe excellencies are 1. in their worth, <hi>the precious oyntment;</hi> 2. in their uſe and application, which is to conſecrate and make men Prieſts unto God, by the vertues conferred upon their principall faculties; <hi>upon the head, the beard, Aarons beard;</hi> 3. in their abundance and fruitfull proceeding from the head to all the inferiour parts, <hi>it ran down upon the beard, went down upon the skirts of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Verſ.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>The bodily bleſſings beſtowed in the Common-wealth are the fruits of the earth in the higheſt parts thereof both farre from the Church, and neer unto the ſame. <hi>As the dew of Hermon</hi> (a hill and land farre from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> neer <hi>Jordan</hi>) <hi>and the dew that deſcendeth upon the mountaines of Zion, Verſ.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>All this goodneſſe and pleaſantneſſe doth accompany bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly unitie, <hi>becauſe the Lord hath commanded the bleſſing to bee there</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> where unitie is) and the bleſſing which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded is, <hi>even life for evermore, Verſ.</hi> 3. and conſequently all the meanes of life, and if of life eternall, then of temporall alſo, for wee have the promiſe, that <hi>if wee ſeek the kingdome of God and his righteouſneſſe all other things ſhall bee added unto us, Matth.</hi> 6.33. Now from all this which is the cleer doctrine of the holy Ghoſt, I ſhall make this inference onely, that if theſe promiſes are made to brotherly unitie, by reaſon of the bleſſing of God upon thoſe that maintain it in Church and Common-wealth, then we may denounce the contrary threatnings unto thoſe that maintain it not,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.8, 9.</note> for <hi>the wrath of God is upon thoſe that are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and obey not the truth.</hi> Hitherto of unitie. The ground of it is love, as may bee gathered from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.25. where the ſame care of members one for another (which is the effect of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:116741:48"/>their love) is the cauſe why there is no rent in the body, and conſequently why unitie is preſerved: For where that loving care is not, unitie is not, but a rent will bee, as wee may daily perceive in our dolefull eſtate. Therefore all the excellencies that belong to brotherly unitie are firſt and originally to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed unto charity. But then there are yet other excellencies, which are more immediatly attributed unto it by the holy Ghoſt, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. where the Apoſtle having in the foregoing Chapter, from the beginning, reckoned up the ſpirituall gifts, which are given to the Saints in the Church to profit withall in the unitie of the body, (as is cleer from <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. compared with <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12, 13. of <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.) he commeth in the concluſion of that Chapter to exhort the Saints <hi>to covet earneſtly the beſt gifts;</hi> and to encourage them unto this dutie, he promiſeth to ſhew them the way which is (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) moſt excellent. Which is that which immediatly in the following 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Chapter he begins to deſcribe. From whence this inference doth offer it ſelfe, <hi>that as the chief and moſt excellent meanes to attaine to all ſpirituall gifts, is the practiſe and exerciſe of love, ſo the neglect of that dutie is the chief cauſe of the decay and loſſe of all ſpirituall gifts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Apoſtle in the deſcription of this way doth ſhew a Threefold excellencie, and uſefulneſſe of love. The firſt is, that without it no ſpirituall talents or good workes are profitable to the Church, or to our owne ſalvation, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1, 2, 3. The ſecond is, that in it and by it all vertues tending to make a man perfect, are wrought in us, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4, 5, 6. 7. The third is, that above all other graces, it is the onely durable and laſting unto eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Which doctrine being referred to the foregoing propoſition in the laſt verſe of Chap. 12. will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this argument, or demonſtration concerning the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That vertue without which no gifts nor good workes are uſefull unto any, and by which all vertues are wrought in us, and which alone laſteth unto eternitie, is the moſt excellent way to ſpirituall gifts.</hi> But ſo it is, <hi>that charitie is that vertue;</hi> Ergo, <hi>it is of all others the moſt excellent way to ſpirituall gifts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Minor or the Aſſumption of this argument is made good concerning charitie, in the three ſeverall parts thereof forementioned.</p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:116741:49"/>
                  <p> Firſt then, that without it no ſpirituall talents and outward good workes are uſefull; the Apoſtle doth make out in many particulars. For he firſt mentioned <hi>the gift of utterance,</hi> ſuppoſe <hi>a man could ſpeake with the tongues of men and Angels,</hi> yet if hee want charitie, he is to his auditory but <hi>as ſounding braſſe, or a tinkling Cymbale, Verſ.</hi> 1. Afterwards the gifts of propheſie, <hi>of underſtanding all myſteries, of all knowledge, of all faith to doe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, yet if there be no charitie,</hi> he declareth that all this is of no uſe and vertue neither to the Church nor to him that hath it, <hi>Ver.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Then concerning good workes, he ſuppoſeth the largeſt and moſt compaſſionate <hi>relief of the poore;</hi> and the greateſt conſtancy <hi>in martyrdome for the truth,</hi> even that a man ſhould give <hi>his body to bee burnt;</hi> yet if there be no charity, all theſe workes will availe him nothing, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. Charitie then is more excellent then theſe gifts, and is to bee counted the life, and as it were the ſoule of them all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that by charitie all vertues are wrought in us, the Apoſtle doth in like manner declare in many particulars. For the vertues which make us perfect, for our behaviour towards <hi>perſons</hi> in <hi>actions</hi> and about <hi>things,</hi> they all proceed from cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
                  <p>For our behaviour towards <hi>perſons:</hi> if others bee croſſe and froward, it teacheth <hi>long-ſuffering.</hi> If they bee good and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it teacheth <hi>kindneſſe;</hi> if they are in glory and proſperity, <hi>it doth not envie their condition;</hi> if wee in reſpect of our ſelves find ſome excellencies or eminencies in our own condition which others have not, <hi>it doth not ſuffer us to vaunt thereof towards others, nor to be puffed up thereby within our ſelves, Verſ.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>For our behaviour in <hi>actions</hi> whether they bee <hi>our own</hi> or <hi>other mens,</hi> whether <hi>evill</hi> or <hi>good,</hi> charity doth teach the vertues which are to bee exerciſed in them.</p>
                  <p>In our <hi>own actions</hi> in reſpect of the forme, <hi>charity doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have it ſelfe unſeemly;</hi> in reſpect of the end, <hi>it ſeeketh not her own.</hi> In the actions of <hi>others,</hi> if they bee evill, <hi>it is not provoked eaſily to wrath,</hi> or ſharpneſſe by them, if they bee good, <hi>it doth not thinke evill of them, Verſ.</hi> 5. its own proper action <hi>is joy;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the object is <hi>not iniquitie</hi> but <hi>truth,</hi> whether in our ſelves or others, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. For our behaviour about <hi>things,</hi> if the things are indifferent and preſent as done by others, <hi>it beareth with them;</hi>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:116741:49"/>if the things are good, and ſaid or promiſed by others, <hi>it belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them;</hi> or abſent and expected from others, <hi>it hopeth for them;</hi> if the things are evill, <hi>it endureth them, Verſ.</hi> 7. Thus in all reſpects it doth make a man compleat in all vertues: So that it is not without cauſe, that the Apoſtle doth call it, <hi>the bond of perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and in that reſpect doth exhort us above all other endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to exerciſe our ſelves therein, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Above all theſe things put on charitie which is the bond of perfectneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that of all other graces neceſſary to make us perfect unto ſalvation, charitie is alone the permanent vertue, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth ſhew.

                     <hi>Sect. III.</hi> Of the common rules of Chriſtianitie, as they are more eſpecially obligatory unto Miniſters in the duties of their calling.</head>
                  <p>BEſides the lovelineſſe and excellency of theſe vertues which doth commend to all the practiſe thereof in a common way, there are three ſpeciall conſiderations, which ought to induce Miniſters of the Goſpell to entertaine in the workes of their Miniſtery one with another, the duties of brotherly communion and correſpondency following thereupon. The firſt is taken from the rules, <hi>which are common to all profeſſors, without which none can bee anſwerable unto the calling, wherewith hee is called unto Chriſtianity it ſelfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is taken <hi>from the laudable practiſe of thoſe who
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:116741:50"/>are ſet before them, as infallible examples in the Miniſtery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the third is taken <hi>from the conſideration of thoſe things, which God doth peculiarly require of them as they are Miniſters.</hi> So that none who neglecteth theſe duties will bee able to approve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the beautie of holineſſe, either a true Chriſtian by the common profeſſion; or an upright follower of Chriſt and his Apoſtles in the Miniſtery; or a faithfull ſervant to the truſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto him in his charge; but in the day of accounts muſt expect to receive, not the praiſe due to <hi>the good</hi> and <hi>faithfull,</hi> but the reproof to be given to the <hi>wicked and ſlothfull</hi> ſervant,<note place="margin">Marth. 25.21.23.26.</note> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his reward.</p>
                  <p>As for the duties of the common profeſſion, wherein profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors are obliged to relate to one another, and which to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect are mainly preſſed upon the conſciences of all againe and again &amp; commended unto us in the Scriptures as matters, which to uphold the integritie of the profeſſion before the world, are moſt of all neceſſary, they are nothing elſe, but the effects of unitie and love in truth and holineſſe. For truth and holineſſe are the fundamentalls of a ſingle profeſſion; but without the effects of love and unitie in theſe, there can bee no common profeſſion, or publick manifeſtation of the life of Chriſt unto the world by a body of Profeſſors. And for this cauſe Chriſt hath made the fundamentall law of the profeſſion in common, and the badge of his diſciples unto the world to bee this, that <hi>they ſhould love one another as hee hath loved them Iohn</hi> 13.34, 35. <hi>A new commandement I give unto you, that yee love one another as I have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you, that yee alſo love one another: by this ſhall all men know that yee are my diſciples, if yee have love one to another.</hi> Now if this Law is common to all as they are Chriſtians, ſo that the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours thereof doe forfeit their right in Chriſtianitie and are not to bee acknowledged Chriſts Diſciples if they perſevere in this fault, then it is evident that ſuch of the Miniſtery as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it not in their Miniſteriall relation one towards another, are farre more guiltie then others, becauſe their charge in the common profeſſion doth oblige them more to this dutie then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in as much as they are more bound thereby to uphold the truth of the profeſſion then others are; for they are the joynts of the body, and the inſtruments of the communion between the members; which if they through want of love to each
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:116741:50"/>other, do either breake or not advance, they are not onely guiltie of their owne diſunion from their fellow labourers in the Miniſtery, but alſo of the disjoynting of all other profeſſors and members of Chriſt, one from another in the way of the common calling. And this is ſo much the more to be heeded, by how much the Scripture is more frequent and earneſt in preſſing this dutie and the effects thereof; then any other thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in the obedience of Faith. To reckon up all the particular commandements and ſtrong motives which are in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, to enforce the practiſe of this dutie, is not my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at this time; but I would onely remonſtrate unto thoſe that intend to bee faithfull unto God and conſcionable in their miniſtery, that as the fundamentall Lawes of the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, which are the practiſe of love and unitie, belong more unto them in reſpect of each other, then unto ſingle members, in reſpect of one another, (becauſe mutuall love and unitie in the Miniſters entertained or not entertained doth beget or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the ſame in common profeſſors) ſo the effects, meanes and conſequents of thoſe duties are more eminently the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their calling then of any others. Therefore I ſhall briefly point at ſome places of Scripture wherein the chief ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and meanes of thoſe fundamentals are earneſtly recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto all, that the Miniſtery of this age may ſee therein the rule of their comportment, and how far wee are ſtrayed from it. Wee are then all commanded, and that as a dutie wherein wee are to walke <hi>worthy of the vocation wherewith wee are called, to ſtudy the unitie of the Spirit in the bond of peace,</hi> becauſe all our funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall relations to all the meanes, and to Chriſt and God the Authors of our ſalvation, are one and the ſame, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 4. 5, 6. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10, 11, 12, 13. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.13, 14, 15. Therefore wee are commanded againe and againe <hi>to be of the ſame mind each towards another, Rom.</hi> 12.16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.2. <hi>to have the ſame love, and to be of one accord, Phil.</hi> 2.2. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8. and 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.7, 8.11, 12. &amp; 5.1. and 2 <hi>John</hi> 5, 6. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. and the meaſure and hight of this love is, that we are bound in imitation of Chriſt <hi>to lay downe our lives for our brethren,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.16. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.12, 13. far more then ought wee to deny our ſelves in leſſer things.</p>
                  <p>The effects of theſe graces and the meanes to honour the holy

                  </list>
                  <p>Of all which and ſuch like duties, whereof the Scriptures are full, and which tend to perfect the Saints in their holy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and to direct brethren in the common profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie to advance truth and holineſſe in themſelves, and others, wee muſt ſay this, that they oblige Miniſters in a threefold reſpect above others. For they are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound to obſerve theſe rules in all their wayes as they are Chriſtians, but they are moreover bound to obſerve them, Firſt, towards all more eminently then other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon profeſſors, becauſe they are appointed to bee the <hi>Salt of the earth, and the light of the world, and as a City built upon a hill that cannot bee bid, Matth.</hi> 5.13, 14. Secondly, towards their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Miniſters more eſpecially and diſtinctly then towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe they are bound to them by a double tie of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> by that of Chriſtianitie, and that of the Miniſtery. And thirdly, they are bound to obſerve theſe rules towards the workes and in the performances of their Miniſteriall adminiſtrations more exactly then in and towards other common duties; becauſe thoſe workes and performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are of a more important nature, then other workes, as being more univerſall and more leading in their kind, and ſuch as more neerly concerne the glory of God, and reflect upon the ſoules of men in order to him, ſo that a ſmall failing in any of theſe is more hurtfull to the profeſſion then a greater fault in any other kind. So that wee muſt forcibly conclude, that becauſe all the common rules of Chriſtianitie, are more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory unto Miniſters towards one another in the duties of their calling then unto common profeſſors; that therefore the chief and moſt fundamentall rules of the holy profeſſion which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne love and unitie, communion and correſpondency, are more binding towards them, chiefly in the workes of their Miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all adminiſtration, then towards any others: and conſequently that the neglect of the leaſt of theſe duties, in any of them, is a greater guilt and leſſe excuſable, then in any others, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of a groſſe miſdemenour. A little moat in the eye will trouble the whole body more, then a great handfull of dirt and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:116741:52"/>duſt caſt upon any other part of the face, and the leaſt prick that may bee in the heart or in the <hi>pia mater</hi> of the braine (as Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians ſay) will kill a man infallibly; but a great wound in the fleſh, nay a ſtab through the whole body may be cured. A thorne in a ſmall joynt will indanger a gangrene to the whole body, whereas a great impoſtume in a part of the fleſh will be without danger &amp;, may be a means (though with ſome trouble) to purge the whole of many evill humours. Thus a little ſparke of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection in one Miniſter againſt another, or breach of unitie in the leaſt dutie of their charge, may prove infinitely more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the whole Church of God, then great and groſſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilities in common profeſſors for matters of outward concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Now amongſt all the faults and defaults of Miniſters in their charge, that of the want of mutuall love, and of care to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the unitie of the ſpirit in the profeſſion of Chriſtianitie; together with a delight to ſtand at a diſtance by themſelves, is to me one of the greateſt, becauſe it doth directly croſſe the chief end of their Miniſteriall function, which is to gather the beleevers into one viſible body, and to bring that body to the perfection of ſpirituall unitie (which may bee cleerly gathered from <hi>John</hi> 17.21, 22, 23. compared with <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.12, 13, 14, 15, 16.) And if this bee the chiefe end of their Miniſtery, then the maine neglect of the meanes by which this end may bee obtained, and without which it cannot bee proſecuted, muſt needs bee their greateſt guilt; whence it will cleerly follow, that to maintain no communion in ſpirituall things one with another is one of their greateſt faults, becauſe moſt directly croſſe to the end of their adminiſtration. So then, if to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſpirituall communion is a dutie in this reſpect fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and neceſſary, then it followeth that the engagements un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a concurrence, and the lawfull wayes of ſpirituall corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency are alſo fundamentall and neceſſary to the work of the Miniſtery, and muſt bee entertained, becauſe without theſe the dutie of holy Communion cannot bee maintained, nor the unities of the Church brought to any viſible perfection, but rather viſibly diſſolved.</p>
                  <p>Thus then upon this conſideration it is an undeniable Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall truth, That for the Miniſters of the Goſpel, in the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:116741:52"/>duties of their Miniſteriall charge, nothing is more conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, nothing more commendable, nothing more profitable, and nothing more ſutable to the glory of God, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the Saints, then that they ſhould maintaine a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly communion and correſpondency one with another, and ſuch as neglect it, walke not worthy of the calling wherewith they are called in the common profeſſion of Chriſtianitie.</p>

For by God, and by himſelfe juſtly in reſpect of the imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſinnes to him, and by ſinners unjuſtly hee was num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred in his life, and in his death one of them, for their good to ſave them. This example of Chriſt in his Miniſtery made the Apoſtle <hi>Paul become all things unto all men that hee might gaine ſome and partake of the Goſpel with every one,</hi> as hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth ſet forth his owne practiſe, to exhort us to follow it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>till</hi> 24. Now if Chriſt and the Apoſtles did thus behave themſelves with indifferencie, and apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without reſpect of perſons by their Miniſtery unto all, that were any way capable of the outward meanes of edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (though great ſinners otherwiſe) how can the practiſe of a Separation, or of a Semiſeparation be warranted, and that even from thoſe, who in reſpect of their profeſſion cannot bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to bee our brethren? Should wee dare to put upon mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that are meerly circumſtantiall, and upon things no where expreſly enjoyned, but rather taken up by our ſelves, more weight then upon all theſe fundamentall duties of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and upon the undeniable practiſe of Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in the worke of their Miniſtery? If wee doe make our ſelves, and our owne wayes the meaſure of all perfection, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wee become perfect Idols to, and Idolaters of our ſelves in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:116741:54"/>Gods worſhip. For if in the outward meanes of worſhipping and drawing neer to God in publick, though his owne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances bee obſerved as hee hath appointed them, as to the outward man, (for to the inward fellowſhip hee himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone doth admit whomſoever hee pleaſeth) yet if then wee love to ſet our ſelves at a diſtance from others, or reject others from being partakers with us of the ordinances, either becauſe wee count them in holineſſe inferiour to us, or becauſe wee are not ſatisfied concerning their ſinceritie, or becauſe they come not up to joyne in opinion with us, concerning all the circumſtantials of our way. If I ſay for theſe, or ſuch like cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, wee ſtand aloof in the common profeſſion; and think that God is no where to be found but in our way and ſocietie; doe wee not Idolize our ſelves? doe wee not make our ſelves the onely rule of all perfection, and ſay in our hearts, <hi>Stand thou by thy ſelfe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 65.5.</note> 
                     <hi>come not neer, for I am holyer then thou.</hi> And what can bee imagined more oppoſit to the love, humilitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion of Chriſt and his Apoſtles in the way of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery? Let us therefore take heed to this ſnare, let us count nothing perfect, but that which upon the grounds of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon profeſſion is conformable to the example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, who came into the world to ſave and draw ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners unto God, not by a diſtance, but by a condeſcenſion unto them in their weakneſſe.</p>
                  <p>As for the communion and correſpondencie which the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Miniſters maintained one with another in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall workes; wee ſhall find that it did tend to theſe foure ends.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>to advance the converſion of the Gentiles to the faith and profeſſion of Chriſtianitie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>to build up and confirme thoſe that had received the truth of the Goſpel, that they might be ſetled therein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>to preſerve thoſe that were ſetled from the danger of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, <hi>to ſtrengthen themſelves in the workes of their employment towards the Churches.</hi> All which aimes are ſtill neceſſary to bee followed, and therefore the meanes which are ſerviceable thereunto, and which they then uſed muſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:116741:54"/>not now bee neglected, if they can bee ſet afoote.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, wee find then that for the propagation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel amongſt the Gentiles ſome went forth to preach unto them the name of Chriſt, <hi>and tooke nothing of them. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſuch and bring them forward on their journey after a Godly ſort,</hi> was a worke of holy Communion commended in <hi>Gajus</hi> by the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> as being a dutie, which all ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, and the ground why all ought to intend it is, that all <hi>may be fellow-helpers to the truth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3 John 6.7, 8.</note> This practiſe then is ſtill to bee followed by all that are called to the Miniſtery, ſo long as the propagation of the truth ſhall be neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for the confirmation and edification of converts in the faith by the care of neighbour Miniſters correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with thoſe that did convert them, wee have an example in <hi>Acts</hi> 8.14. where the Miniſters of the Church at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> ſent to <hi>Samaria</hi> two of their number to confirme the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers and build them up in the faith; in like manner when they heard that ſome were turned unto the Lord in <hi>Antioch,</hi> they ſent <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and he went to the ſame end and purpoſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.20, 21, 22, 23.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for the preſervation of the truth from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Seducers, and the deciſion of doubts in doctrine and practiſe caſt in amongſt the profeſſours to trouble them, wee have an example of Brotherly Communion and Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>till</hi> 30. where one Church doth crave and another doth contribute aſſiſtance, counſell and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in a Synodicall way towards the deciſion and ſettlement of the difference which broke forth amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the example wherein Miniſters amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did ſtrengthen one another in the worke of their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment towards the Churches, is that of the Apoſtles of the Jewes and Gentiles, who having communicated together con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the doctrine which they preached, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. and made known to one another their practiſe, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe</hi> 3, 4, 5, 6. to gaine mutuall approbation and confirmation therein, <hi>Verſe</hi> 6.7, 8. they did enter into a contract of followſhip, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9. and an obligation of Communion and communication of good things
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:116741:55"/>between their Churches, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 9, 10. Nor was it found law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or anſwerable to the truth of the Goſpel, that upon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane conſiderations or partiall reſpects that Communion ſhould be broken, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. till the end.</p>
                  <p>From all which againe doth follow that which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath beene concluded; that nothing is more conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nothing more commendable, nothing more profitable, and nothing more ſutable to the glory of God and the perfecting of the Saints in the worke of the Miniſtery, then that the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould maintaine a Brotherly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and correſpondency one with another, and that ſuch as neglect this dutie walke not worthy of the calling where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are called in imitation of Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</p>

                     <hi>Sect. V.</hi> Concerning that which concernes the Office of the Miniſtery in it ſelf.</head>
                  <p>IF wee reflect upon the Miniſteriall office in it ſelfe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that whereunto it hath a ſpeciall reference, wee ſhall find, that all Miniſters that are faithfull to their charge are bound at all times to have reſpect unto foure things.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is <hi>their relation unto Chriſt as they are under him who is the head of the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is <hi>their relation to the Church, as therein they are Officers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third is <hi>their relation to the workes of their charge in the Office.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth is <hi>their relation to their fellow labourers in theſe workes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>None of theſe reſpects muſt be wanting, becauſe without their ſubordination unto Chriſt, they are no Miniſters, nor are they otherwiſe in Chriſt, but as they are members of his Church, nor can they bee counted members without a work to performe, becauſe the uſe of every member is to be an Organ of the ſoul in the body: now the ſoul of this body is the ſpirit of Chriſt, and every true beleever is a member Organicall in his own place, that is, appointed to ſome uſefull worke. Nor is any
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:116741:55"/>member alone, but it is put together with the reſt, to make up the whole by mutuall conjunction and cooperation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none doth worke as it is alone, but as it ſtandeth united with its fellow-labourers in every worke. And as none of theſe reſpects can bee wanting in the office of the Miniſtery; ſo none beſides theſe are needfull; for if a member doth duely depend upon his head, and ſtandeth in its right place in the body; and hath a lively facultie to doe its owne worke, and is no wayes disjoynted but fitly compacted and linked to the other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in doing its work, nothing can bee further deſired or wiſhed for in it. Theſe are then the eſſentiall and proper relations, under which a Miniſter as an Officer of the Church is to bee conſidered. Now if it bee found that in the profeſſion of truth and holineſſe, nothing doth make him ſo fit for his office in all theſe relations, as to maintaine the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of brotherly love, unitie, communion and correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and that without the ſtudie of theſe, hee cannot ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in any of thoſe relations; then I ſuppoſe that theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will without contradiction bee acknowledged to bee the moſt commendable and uſefull that hee can apply himſelfe unto, and that without the obſervance of the ſame, hee cannot bee ſaid to walke worthy of the vocation wherewith hee is called.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore take theſe relations into a more diſtinct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and ſee how therein by theſe duties a Miniſter is fitted for his office.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, then a Miniſter by his Office is ſubordinate unto Chriſt, as a <hi>Servant,</hi> as a <hi>Diſciple,</hi> and as a <hi>friend of his;</hi> and to make theſe relations evident to the world and ſure to himſelf, is to make his calling and election ſure; which is effected when both others are made to ſee, and hee himſelf doth aſſuredly of himſelfe know, that what hee doth in his charge, is done to ſerve Chriſt as it becommeth his Diſciple and friend. But except his behaviour in all the workes of his charge bee ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that love whereby Chriſt his maſter did love us, and thereby did unite himſelfe unto us, theſe relations will not bee evidenced.</p>
                  <p>For to be a faithfull ſervant of Chriſt he muſt make two things
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:116741:56"/>appeare. Firſt, that <hi>hee ſerves none but him alone,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10. and as Chriſt requires of all to bee done, when hee tells <hi>us that none can ſerve two maſters, Matth.</hi> 6.24. And ſecondly, <hi>that hee applies himſelfe to the ſame worke which Chriſt did.</hi> For hee commands all his <hi>ſervants to follow him, Iohn</hi> 12.26. namely, in that ſervice which hee performed, which was to doe the will and manifeſt the love of his Father unto us; therefore the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. in order to this, doth profeſſe not <hi>to preach himſelfe, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, and himſelfe a ſervant to the Corinthians for Ieſus ſake.</hi> This was to be a ſervant of the love of Jeſus to us, to invite all to bee <hi>reconciled to God for his ſake,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19.21. and 6.1. As the imployment is nothing elſe but a ſervice of love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.13. that is, to expreſſe the love and <hi>fulfill the Law of Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.14.</note> 
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2. ſo the infallible character of a diſciple by which hee is to bee diſtinguiſhed in the world from all others, is mutuall love and unitie, as is cleer by <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.35. and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as well as in holding forth the word, they are to approve themſelves <hi>to bee the light of the world, Matth.</hi> 5.14. which will appeare by comparing theſe two places, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16. with 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.9, 10, 11. The whole relation then of being a true ſervant and Diſciple, is evidenced by nothing more then by this worke of love and mutuall unitie. Laſtly alſo it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that none can claime the title of being Chriſts friend, but by the performance of this dutie: For Chriſt hath intai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the right to this dignitie wholly upon this condition; which is cleerly expreſſed <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>This is my commandement, that yee love one another as I have loved you; greater love hath no man then this, that a man lay downe his life for his friends: Yee are my friends if yee doe whatſoever I command you, &amp;c.</hi> And when in <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. and 16. hee hath ſhewed, how much by his friendſhip to them hee hath obliged them alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and what further obligations they ſhould receive from his Father, hee concludes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. thus. <hi>Theſe things I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you, that you love one another.</hi> So that hee puts all the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which wee have to him of ſervants, of diſciples and of friends, upon the expreſſion of our love to each other; from whence wee muſt forcibly conclude, that if there bee no ſuch
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:116741:56"/>expreſſion of love, but rather of diſaffection, and of hatred to one another in our Miniſtery, that wee make it apparent unto the world; and to our owne conſciences, when they awake, it will bee evident, that wee are none of his ſervants, nor his diſciples, nor his friends; but rather the ſervant, diſciples, and friends of his enemy,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> the Prince of <hi>wickedneſſe in heavenly matters.</hi> Therefore let no man bee deceived with faire preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of holineſſe, and with large pleas and diſcourſes about ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall rights; the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>that if wee have bitter envy and ſtrife in our hearts one againſt another, and if wee glory therein, wee lie againſt the truth:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iam. 3.14, 15.16.</note> For <hi>the wiſedome</hi> by which men are led in ſuch caſes, <hi>deſcendeth not from above, but is earthly, ſenſuall, and devilliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in relation to the Church, as it is a houſe of God, the Miniſters therein <hi>are builders,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12. as it is the houſhold of faith, they are <hi>ſtewards of the Myſteries of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.1, 2. and as it is a flock they <hi>are ſhepheards</hi> thereof, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. Now if in building the ſame houſe there bee no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence and correſpondency between the builders thereof, how will it bee fitly framed together as it ought to bee? <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 20.21. Can builders that have no ſpirituall communion, but are rather diſunited in their wayes, frame fitly one and the ſame houſe for Gods ſpirit to dwell in? And if in a great houſhold, where one ſteward cannot overſee all, ſeverall ſtewards being appointed to do all by one and the ſame rule of adminiſtration; yet they agree not amongſt themſelves, but walke different wayes and croſſe each other: will not this diſtraction diſorder the affaires of the houſhold? will not this reflect upon their Lord and Maſter, as if he could not govern his family in peace? And if ſeverall ſhepheards belonging to a great flock to feed it joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, doe every one take a part thereof for himſelf, and feed it ſeparately each from other, without any care to maintaine good neighbourhood and acquaintance, but rather to croſſe one another in their walkes, and draw ſheep one from another, how will they bee able to anſwer it to him that hath intruſted them with the joynt care of his flock? I find that when the ſoul which is in love with Chriſt doth ſeeke to find him out,<note place="margin">Cant. 1.7.8.</note> it is afraid to turne aſide unto the <hi>flockes of his companions;</hi> and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:116741:57"/>when it is directed how to come to him, it is bid goe forth by the footſteps of <hi>the flock, and feed beſides the ſhepheards tents:</hi> whence wee may obſerve, that the multitude <hi>of flocks</hi> under many pretending to bee Chriſts companions, doe perplex the ſoule, and turne it aſide from him, but the unitie <hi>of the flock</hi> under ſhepheards that are united, is the way wherein Chriſt is to bee found.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, their relation to the workes of their employment doth wholly neceſſitate them to maintaine mutuall love and unitie; becauſe not onely theſe duties in themſelves are a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall part of their worke; but what ever elſe doth belong to their charge, whether it concerne the Church or the Goſpel; it can neither bee acceptable unto God, nor profitable unto men, except it bee done in the ſpirit of love and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, that theſe duties are recommended unto them, as a maine part of the very worke, which is chiefly to be ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at in their profeſſion, I ſuppoſe hath been abundantly made out by that which formerly hath been alleadged.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that nothing can bee acceptable unto God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this frame of ſpirit, is evident, becauſe <hi>God is love, and hee that loveth not, knoweth not God,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.8. and on the contrary <hi>hee that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God and God in him, ibid. Verſ.</hi> 16. Moreover he that <hi>doth not all his workes in love,</hi> as he is commanded, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.14. <hi>tranſgreſeth the whole Law,</hi> by the unlovely frame of his ſpirit, becauſe as <hi>love is the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the whole Law, Rom.</hi> 13.8, 9, 10. So the want of it, muſt needs bee the tranſgreſſion of the whole Law; and hee that <hi>is not ſubject to the Law of God cannot pleaſe him,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7, 8.</p>
                  <p>And as nothing can bee acceptable unto God, which is not done in love, ſo it cannot bee profitable unto men; For if God bleſſe it not, how can it proſper towards them, and how can hee bleſſe that which is diſpleaſing to him? And then the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>knowledge</hi> is apt <hi>to puffe</hi> men <hi>up, but it is Charitie which edifieth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1. And what I ſay of love may bee verified of unitie; as it is the fruit of love inſeparable from it in Chriſts aime: <hi>John</hi> 17.23. and equally recommended to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:116741:57"/>us by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.1. <hi>till</hi> 7. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.2. whence wee ſee, that all things which are to bee done by any muſt thus bee qualified to find acceptance; but if wee looke more diſtinctly upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per workes of their employment towards the Church and for the Goſpel; wee ſhall perceive more cleerly the intrinſecall coherence which is found between theſe duties and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall adminiſtrations.</p>
                  <p>For the workes of their adminiſtration towards the Church are all the Ordinances of God belonging to the publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the word and prayer, whereunto the Sacraments,<note place="margin">Acts 6.4.</note> the Government and the Diſcipline are ſubordinate, that therein by the Word and Prayer the Saints may have communion with God through the Spirit. The whole ſubſtance and ſumme of all that they have to doe, is expreſſed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. from <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. till 17. where I obſerve that all the gifts and Offices which Chriſt hath given to his Church,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. Verſ. 11.</note> both the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, <hi>of Apoſtles, Prophets, and Evangeliſts,</hi> and the ordinary <hi>of Paſtors and teachers,</hi> their worke is the ſame towards the Church unto the worlds end; namely this. 1. To bee ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>in perfecting the Saints, and in building up the body of Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſ. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>in Faith and knowledge, till they all come to the unitie thereof, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſ. 13.</note> Where wee ſee that the end of their worke is nothing elſe but the perfection of unitie, and conſequently if any ſhould not aime at this, it is evident that they come ſhort of the true end of their adminiſtration of the ordinances, and ſhoot not at the marke which God hath ſet before them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, their ſervice is to preſerve by this meanes the Profeſſors of Chriſtianitie from that unſettlement which is brought upon thoſe that are children in underſtanding by the different doctrines of men and <hi>their ſleights and cunning craftineſſe whereby they lay in wait to deceive</hi> the ſimple and draw diſciples after them: whence wee may gather that if the true Miniſters had done their worke as they ſhould have done in love and unitie from the beginning of the Reformation, the deceivers of theſe times would never have prevailed ſo as they have done hitherto. But becauſe this hath not been intended, therefore
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:116741:58"/>they have gotten all the advantages that they can deſire and wiſh for, both againſt us and all other Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, their worke is not onely to unite them in faith and knowledge,<note place="margin">Verſ. 15.</note> and to preſerve them from ſeducers, but to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour their growth in all things into him, who is their head Chriſt, by the ſinceritie and truth of love.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and to this effect their worke is <hi>to compact them and joyne them together as one body to build up themſelves in love by that which every joynt is able to ſupply unto another.</hi>

                  <p>Whence wee may moſt evidently perceive that the whole ſubſtance of their worke towards the Church and Saints to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them and build them up, is in effect nothing but this, to unite them in the faith and knowledge of Chriſt, to preſerve them from unſettlement, and to cauſe them grow up within themſelves by the loving communication of their graces to each other. As concerning the work which they are to intend for the Goſpel to maintain the profeſſion of it in the world; it is in a word to uphold <hi>the truth which is after godlineſſe;</hi> that it may be acknowledged to bee <hi>the grace of God which bringeth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 1.1.</note> and that it may appeare unto all men; <hi>to teach them to deny ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 2.11, 12, 13, 14.</note> 
                     <hi>and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world, looking for the bleſſed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and the Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelfe for us that hee might redeeme us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelfe a peculiar people zealous of good workes.</hi> Now to hold forth this word of life, the Apoſtle requireth in all Profeſſours, and therefore moſt of all in the Miniſters of the profeſſion, that they <hi>ſhould doe all things without murmurings and diſputings,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 2.14.</note> 
                     <hi>and that they ſhould bee</hi> (in their converſation) <hi>blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and harmeleſſe, as the Sonnes of God, without rebuke, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe nation, and that they ſhould ſtand faſt in in one Spirit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 1.27.</note> 
                     <hi>with one mind, ſtriving together for the faith of the Goſpel.</hi> Where wee may obſerve that in that worke which is proper to the advancement of the Goſpel of truth in the world, the holineſſe of life, the peaceableneſſe and the unitie of the profeſſors, are the neceſſary requiſites without which nothing in this kind can bee effected: For this worke hath two parts. The one is towards the children of truth, the other is againſt
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:116741:58"/>the adverſaries of truth. Towards the children of truth, the worke is in reſpect of the common profeſſion, to concurre <hi>in the wayes of righteouſneſſe, of faith, of charitie and of peace with all thoſe that call upon God out of a pure heart,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.22. and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the aime of mutuall edification for practiſe, <hi>it is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort one another daily whiles it is called to day, Hebr.</hi> 3.13. <hi>and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke one another to love and to good workes, Heb.</hi> 10.24. and for knowledge, it is to endeavour <hi>that their hearts may bee comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full aſſurance of underſtanding, to the acknowledgment of the myſtery of God and of the Father, and of Chriſt in whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and knowledge, Col.</hi> 2.2, 3. Where we ought to obſerve that the ſtudie of love and unitie have not onely an influence upon the common profeſſion, and that part of the peculiar worke of edification, which is practicall to maintain it, but alſo that it is a meanes to confirme and comfort the hearts of the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>in all the riches of the full aſſurance of the knowledge</hi> of the higheſt and moſt ſecret Myſteries. And conſequently that where this ſtudie is not entertained, there both the profeſſion and all the comforts which ariſe unto the ſoules of beleevers practically and intellectually from their peculiar intereſts in each others edification, doe wholly decay, and the great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our ſalvation concerning God and the Father and Chriſt are darkned, made doubtfull, and by ſome utterly contradicted, all which is brought to paſſe now adayes as much, if not more then in any age heretofore by our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſions.</p>
                  <p>As for the adverſaries and gaineſayers who are to bee oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, if wee take them to bee <hi>the principalities and powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſpiritualities of malice in high places,</hi> a chief part of the armour by which we are to fight againſt them and preſerve our ſelves from their aſſaults is, to have our <hi>Loines,</hi> (that is, our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections) <hi>girt about with truth</hi> (that is, with ſincere love, <hi>which is the bond of perfectneſſe</hi>) <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.14. <hi>and to have our feet ſhod</hi> (that is, our wayes of converſion fitted) <hi>with the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel of peace,</hi> (that is, with meanes of peace,<note place="margin">Col. 3.14. with Epheſ. 4.15.</note> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare men to entertain without offence and peaceably the Goſpel of the peace of God, which is revealed in his word to us, <hi>Epheſ.</hi>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:116741:59"/>6.15. But if wee take the oppoſers to bee men, although ſometimes <hi>their mouthes muſt be ſtopped,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 1.10, 11, 12, 13. Tit. 3.9. 2 Tim. 2.23.</note> 
                     <hi>and they ſharply rebuked,</hi> namely, when it is evident that they are <hi>vain talkers, unruly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers and liars:</hi> yet alwayes matters <hi>of ſtrife and jangling</hi> both with them and all others, are to bee avoided (which we now have not heeded) and the behaviour of the ſervant of God even in his greateſt zeale, and in the worſt of times muſt never bee precipitate and haſty, that is, without <hi>long-ſuffering,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2, 3. But chiefly towards ſuch of whom there may be hope of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, <hi>all gentleneſſe, patience, forbearance and meekneſſe of inſtruction is with great care to bee uſed,</hi> as the Apoſtle doth teach <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.24, 25. which is a leſſon almoſt utterly forgotten in theſe our dayes amongſt ſome that eſteeme themſelves the chief of Profeſſors. Thus then wee ſee that there is no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular part of all the Miniſteriall worke wherein the ſpirit of love and unitie muſt not appeare, as the principall agent to make it ſucceſſefull.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, their relation to each other as fellow-labourers in theſe workes, is properly that of joynts, which are between the Members of the body to unite them to each other, and to make them dependent upon the head. For in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. the Apoſtle doth cleerly ſpeak of the viſible body of the Church, as it hath a ſpirituall communion with Chriſt, and within it ſelf by the meanes of that which every joynt ſupplyeth; if then every part by his joynt (that is, by his Miniſter, to whom is joyned a ſocietie of Saints as a part of the whole) is bound to ſupply to another part, that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is his effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all working towards the building up of the body in Love, then it is abſolutely neceſſary for him to correſpond and concur with his neighbour and fellow-joynts: for how can any part ſupply any thing to another part of the body without the joynt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? So then wee muſt obſerve that the Aſſociations of the Saints (which are undeniable true parts of the whole) ſhould edifie one another, by that which every joynt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth. For to that effect joynts are in the body, and the Apoſtle ſaith in <hi>the whole body:</hi> to let us underſtand that all the particular Aſſociations of Beleevers in reſpect of the common profeſſion are to bee counted as one Aſſociation, and that by
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:116741:59"/>the joynts which God hath ſet in the whole, the parts therefore are fitly to bee joyned together; whence wee muſt gather, that Miniſters are not onely joynts to unite individuall Profeſſors into a ſocietie, but to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite one Congregation unto another; for hee ſaith, that the whole is compacted by joynts, it followeth then that the Congregations, though diſtinct by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and one within themſelves, as to their ſeverall joynts, yet ought to bee further joynted with other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and not to bee at a diſtance and ſtand by themſelves as parts of the whole disjoynted from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a which is the poſture whereat many deſire to ſtand, and is the practiſe of too many upon ſeverall pretences, to the great diſhonour of the Goſpel in the common profeſſion of Chriſtianitie.</p>
                  <p>But how contrary this is unto the true end of the publick worſhip of God, to the calling of the Miniſtery, to the aime of Chriſt in giving gifts unto men, to the perfecting of the Saints, and to the edifying of the body of Chriſt, I hope ſuch as are conſcionable will bee able to ſee by that which hath beene hitherto ſaid. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I thinke it needleſſe, to ſpeake much more of this relation which Miniſters ought to maintaine one to another, ſeeing it hath already beene proved, that all the Commandements of brotherly love, of unitie, of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall care, of communion and correſpondency which are given to all Chriſtians in the common profeſſion, are more particularly binding unto Miniſters towards each other, in reſpect of their Miniſteriall charges: Yet I ſhall briefly mention three or foure ſpeciall duties which ſeeme to be enjoyned more diſtinctly unto them, rather as they are Miniſters, then as they are Chriſtians, becauſe they have a reſpect rather unto their publick charge and employment, wherein they relate one another, then unto the common profeſſion by it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they are not onely bound to ſerve all men Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterially as Chriſt ſerved us, but they are by his example and precept more diſtinctly commanded <hi>to ſerve one another,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:116741:60"/>Matth. Chap.</hi> 20. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 27, 28. <hi>Whoſoever will bee chiefe among you let him bee your ſervant, even as the Sonne of man came not to bee miniſtred unto but to miniſter, and give his life a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for many.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, they are bound to looke firſt unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and then to the flock, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 28. <hi>Take heed therefore unto your ſelves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you overſeers, &amp;c.</hi> For <hi>Verſ.</hi> 29. &amp; 30. they are foretold that amongſt them <hi>grievous Wolves will enter in, and of their owne ſelves</hi> (that is, ſome of their owne vocation) <hi>men ſhall ariſe ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw away Diſciples after them.</hi> If then all muſt <hi>looke diligently leſt a root of bitterneſſe ſpring up in the Church and many bee defiled thereby, Hebr.</hi> 12.15. farre more is it the dutie of Miniſters, to looke to each other herein.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they are bound to looke upon themſelves and their gifts, as not for themſelves but for all, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for each other to profit withall, according to that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>The manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every one to profit withall;</hi> to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ordinarily the greateſt and moſt uſefull manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations are given; and they can profit moſt thereby one towards another, becauſe in being profitable thereby unto each other; they are inabled ſo much the more to be profitable unto all.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, in the uſe of their ſpirituall gifts wherein they intend to bee profitable unto all, they are <hi>to ſubject themſelves one to another;</hi> as it is written, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 29.32. <hi>Let the Prophets ſpeake and let the others judge. And the Spirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From all which as the duties of mutuall love and unitie are neceſſarily to bee inferred, ſo the meanes to maintaine and exerciſe the ſame, which are the wayes of ſpirituall communion and correſpondency, muſt needs alſo bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to bee their dutie; for where the end is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, there the meanes alſo, without which that end
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:116741:60"/>cannot bee attained; is alſo commanded: ſo that wee muſt cleerly conclude that this is an undeniable Scripturall Truth.</p>
                  <p>That the Miniſters of the Goſpel are bound to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine brotherly unitie, communion and correſpondency one with another; becauſe in the duties of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall charge, nothing is found more conſcionable, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more commendable, nothing more profitable, and nothing more ſutable to the glory of God, and the calling by which they are called to the perfecting of the Saints, and to the edifying of the body of Chriſt, then this dutie is; and therefore whoſoever doth not walke by this rule, doth not walke worthy of the vocation wherewith hee is called in the Goſpel; and whoſoever doth walke thereby, peace and mercy bee upon him, and upon all the Iſrael of God. <hi>Amen.</hi>
